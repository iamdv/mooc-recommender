They are the basis for the state-of-the-art methods in a wide variety of applications, such as medical diagnosis, image understanding, speech recognition, natural language processing, and many, many more. They are also a foundational tool in formulating many machine learning problems. \n\nThis course is the first in a sequence of three. It describes the two basic PGM representations: Bayesian Networks, which rely on a directed graph; and Markov networks, which use an undirected graph. The course discusses both the theoretical properties of these representations as well as their use in practice.

We see political uprisings, market crashes, and a never ending array of social trends. How do we make sense of it? Models. Evidence shows that people who think with models consistently outperform those who don't. And, moreover people who think with lots of models outperform people who use only one. Why do models make us better thinkers? Models help us to better organize information - to make sense of that fire hose or hairball of data (choose your metaphor) available on the Internet. Models improve our abilities to make accurate forecasts. They help us make better decisions and adopt more effective strategies. They even can improve our ability to design institutions and procedures. In this class, I present a starter kit of models: I start with models of tipping points. I move on to cover models explain the wisdom of crowds, models that show why some countries are rich and some are poor, and models that help unpack the strategic decisions of firm and politicians. \n\nThe models covered in this class provide a foundation for future social science classes, whether they be in economics, political science, business, or sociology. Mastering this material will give you a huge leg up in advanced courses. They also help you in life. Here's how the course will work. For each model, I present a short, easily digestible overview lecture. Then, I'll dig deeper. I'll go into the technical details of the model. Those technical lectures won't require calculus but be prepared for some algebra. For all the lectures, I'll offer some questions and we'll have quizzes and even a final exam. If you decide to do the deep dive, and take all the quizzes and the exam, you'll receive a Course Certificate.

Some of them have to do with events of great importance, such as the founding of a nation. Others tell the stories of great heroes and heroines and their exploits and courage in the face of adversity. Still others are simple tales about otherwise unremarkable people who get into trouble or do some great deed. What are we to make of all these tales, and why do people seem to like to hear them? This course will focus on the myths of ancient Greece and Rome, as a way of exploring the nature of myth and the function it plays for individuals, societies, and nations. We will also pay some attention to the way the Greeks and Romans themselves understood their own myths. Are myths subtle codes that contain some universal truth? Are they a window on the deep recesses of a particular culture? Are they a set of blinders that all of us wear, though we do not realize it? Or are they just entertaining stories that people like to tell over and over? This course will investigate these questions through a variety of topics, including the creation of the universe, the relationship between gods and mortals, human nature, religion, the family, sex, love, madness, and death.\n***********************************************************************************************************\n                                                                           \nCOURSE SCHEDULE\n \n• Week 1: Introduction \nWelcome to Greek and Roman Mythology! This first week we’ll introduce the class, paying attention to how the course itself works. We’ll also begin to think about the topic at hand: myth! How can we begin to define \"myth\"? How does myth work? What have ancient and modern theorists, philosophers, and other thinkers had to say about myth? This week we’ll also begin our foray into Homer’s world, with an eye to how we can best approach epic poetry.\nReadings: No texts this week, but it would be a good idea to get started on next week's reading to get ahead of the game. \nVideo Lectures: 1.1-1.7 \nQuiz: Complete the quiz by the end of the week.\n\n• Week 2: Becoming a Hero \nIn week 2, we begin our intensive study of myth through Homer’s epic poem, the Odyssey. This core text not only gives us an exciting story to appreciate on its own merits but also offers us a kind of laboratory where we can investigate myth using different theoretical approaches. This week we focus on the young Telemachus’ tour as he begins to come of age; we also accompany his father Odysseus as he journeys homeward after the Trojan War. Along the way, we’ll examine questions of heroism, relationships between gods and mortals, family dynamics, and the Homeric values of hospitality and resourcefulness.\nReadings: Homer, Odyssey, books 1-8 \nVideo Lectures: 2.1-2.10 \nQuiz: Complete the quiz by the end of the week.\n \n• Week 3: Adventures Out and Back \nThis week we’ll follow the exciting peregrinations of Odysseus, \"man of twists and turns,\" over sea and land. The hero’s journeys abroad and as he re-enters his homeland are fraught with perils. This portion of the Odyssey features unforgettable monsters and exotic witches; we also follow Odysseus into the Underworld, where he meets shades of comrades and relatives. Here we encounter some of the best-known stories to survive from all of ancient myth.\nReadings: Homer, Odyssey, books 9-16 \nVideo Lectures: 3.1-3.10 \nQuiz: Complete the quiz by the end of the week.\n \n• Week 4: Identity and Signs \nAs he makes his way closer and closer to re-taking his place on Ithaca and with his family, a disguised Odysseus must use all his resources to regain his kingdom. We’ll see many examples of reunion as Odysseus carefully begins to reveal his identity to various members of his household—his servants, his dog, his son, and finally, his wife Penelope—while also scheming against those who have usurped his place.\nReadings: Homer, Odyssey, books 17-24 \nVideo Lectures: 4.1-4.8 \nQuiz: Complete the quiz by the end of the week.\n \n• Week 5: Gods and Humans \nWe will take a close look at the most authoritative story on the origin of the cosmos from Greek antiquity: Hesiod’s Theogony. Hesiod was generally considered the only poet who could rival Homer. The Theogony, or \"birth of the gods,\" tells of an older order of gods, before Zeus, who were driven by powerful passions—and strange appetites! This poem presents the beginning of the world as a time of fierce struggle and violence as the universe begins to take shape, and order, out of chaos.\nReadings: Hesiod, Theogony *(the Works and Days is NOT required for the course)* \nVideo Lectures: 5.1-5.9 \nQuiz: Complete the quiz by the end of the week.\n \n• Week 6: Ritual and Religion \nThis week’s readings give us a chance to look closely at Greek religion in its various guises. Myth, of course, forms one important aspect of religion, but so does ritual. How ancient myths and rituals interact teaches us a lot about both of these powerful cultural forms. We will read two of the greatest hymns to Olympian deities that tell up-close-and-personal stories about the gods while providing intricate descriptions of the rituals they like us humans to perform.\nReadings: Homeric Hymn to Apollo; Homeric Hymn to Demeter (there are two hymns to each that survive, only the LONGER Hymn to Apollo and the LONGER Hymn to Demeter are required for the course) \nVideo Lectures: 6.1-6.7\nQuiz: Complete the quiz by the end of the week.\n \n• Week 7: Justice \nWhat counts as a just action, and what counts as an unjust one? Who gets to decide? These are trickier questions than some will have us think. This unit looks at one of the most famously thorny issues of justice in all of the ancient world. In Aeschylus’ Oresteia—the only surviving example of tragedy in its original trilogy form—we hear the story of Agamemnon’s return home after the Trojan War. Unlike Odysseus’ eventual joyful reunion with his wife and children, this hero is betrayed by those he considered closest to him. This family's cycle of revenge, of which this story is but one episode, carries questions of justice and competing loyalties well beyond Agamemnon’s immediate family, eventually ending up on the Athenian Acropolis itself.\nReadings: Aeschylus, Agamemnon; Aeschylus, Eumenides \nVideo Lectures: 7.1-7.10 \nQuiz: Complete the quiz by the end of the week.\n \n• Week 8: Unstable Selves\nThis week we encounter two famous tragedies, both set at Thebes, that center on questions of guilt and identity: Sophocles’ Oedipus Rex and Eurpides’ Bacchae. Oedipus is confident that he can escape the unthinkable fate that was foretold by the Delphic oracle; we watch as he eventually realizes the horror of what he has done. With Odysseus, we saw how a great hero can re-build his identity after struggles, while Oedipus shows us how our identities can dissolve before our very eyes. The myth of Oedipus is one of transgressions—intentional and unintentional—and about the limits of human knowledge. In Euripides’ Bacchae, the identity of gods and mortals is under scrutiny. Here, Dionysus, the god of wine and of tragedy, and also madness, appears as a character on stage. Through the dissolution of Pentheus, we see the terrible consequences that can occur when a god’s divinity is not properly acknowledged.\nReadings: Sophocles, Oedipus Rex; Euripides, Bacchae \nVideo Lectures: 8.1-8.9\nQuiz: Complete the quiz by the end of the week.\n \n• Week 9: The Roman Hero, Remade \nMoving ahead several centuries, we jump into a different part of the Mediterranean to let the Romans give us their take on myth. Although many poets tried to rewrite Homer for their own times, no one succeeded quite like Vergil. His epic poem, the Aeneid, chronicles a powerful re-building of a culture that both identifies with and defines itself against previously told myths. In contrast to the scarcity of information about Homer, we know a great deal about Vergil’s life and historical context, allowing us insight into myth-making in action.\nReadings: Vergil, Aeneid, books 1-5 \nVideo Lectures: 9.1-9.10 \nQuiz: Complete the quiz by the end of the week.\n \n• Week 10: Roman Myth and Ovid's Metamorphoses \nOur consideration of Vergil’s tale closes with his trip to the underworld in book 6. Next, we turn to a more playful Roman poet, Ovid, whose genius is apparent in nearly every kind of register. Profound, witty, and satiric all at once, Ovid’s powerful re-tellings of many ancient myths became the versions that are most familiar to us today. Finally, through the lens of the Romans and others who \"remythologize,\" we wrap up the course with a retrospective look at myth.\nReadings: Vergil, Aeneid, book 6; Ovid, Metamorphoses, books 3, 12, and 13. \nVideo Lectures: 10.1-10.9.\nQuiz: Complete the quiz by the end of the week.\n \n***********************************************************************************************************\nREADINGS\nThere are no required texts for the course, however, Professor Struck will make reference to the following texts in the lecture:\n• Greek Tragedies, Volume 1, David Grene and Richmond Lattimore, trans.

The course will build upon knowledge acquired through prior studies of cell and molecular biology, general physiology and human anatomy, as we focus primarily on the central nervous system.\n\nThis online course is designed to include all of the core concepts in neurophysiology and clinical neuroanatomy that would be presented in most first-year neuroscience courses in schools of medicine. However, there are some topics (e.g., biological psychiatry) and several learning experiences (e.g., hands-on brain dissection) that we provide in the corresponding course offered in the Duke University School of Medicine on campus that we are not attempting to reproduce in Medical Neuroscience online. Nevertheless, our aim is to faithfully present in scope and rigor a medical school caliber course experience.\n\nThis course comprises six units of content organized into 12 weeks, with an additional week for a comprehensive final exam:\n- Unit 1 Neuroanatomy (weeks 1-2). This unit covers the surface anatomy of the human brain, its internal structure, and the overall organization of sensory and motor systems in the brainstem and spinal cord.\n- Unit 2 Neural signaling (weeks 3-4). This unit addresses the fundamental mechanisms of neuronal excitability, signal generation and propagation, synaptic transmission, post synaptic mechanisms of signal integration, and neural plasticity.\n- Unit 3 Sensory systems (weeks 5-7). Here, you will learn the overall organization and function of the sensory systems that contribute to our sense of self relative to the world around us: somatic sensory systems, proprioception, vision, audition, and balance senses.\n- Unit 4 Motor systems (weeks 8-9). In this unit, we will examine the organization and function of the brain and spinal mechanisms that govern bodily movement.\n- Unit 5 Brain Development (week 10). Next, we turn our attention to the neurobiological mechanisms for building the nervous system in embryonic development and in early postnatal life; we will also consider how the brain changes across the lifespan.\n- Unit 6 Cognition (weeks 11-12). The course concludes with a survey of the association systems of the cerebral hemispheres, with an emphasis on cortical networks that integrate perception, memory and emotion in organizing behavior and planning for the future; we will also consider brain systems for maintaining homeostasis and regulating brain state.", "slug": "coursera-medical-neuroscience", "provider": "Coursera", "universitiesInstitutions": "Duke University", "parentSubject": "Science", "childSubject": "Biology", "category": "Biology", "url": "https://www.coursera.org/learn/medical-neuroscience", "length": 12.0, "language": "English", "credentialName": "", "rating": 4.9117647058824, "numberOfRatings": 34, "certificate": 1.0, "workload": "16-20 hours a week"}, {"courseId": 385, "courseName": "Learn to Program: The Fundamentals", "courseDescription": "Behind every mouse click and touch-screen tap, there is a computer program that makes things happen.

We need to recognize that no matter that outsiders may view a community as poor or neglected, we can find strengths and capacities for improvement in each community. Identifying community capacities and resources is the first step in facilitating community change. Different practical and philosophical approaches to change and therefore, examined. Specific to the change process is our recognition of the need for communities to participate in the design, implementation and evaluation of any intervention.\n\nWe examine the concept of participation in an effort to see how different levels of involvement may affect sustainability of community change efforts.

They can be found nearly everywhere in today’s society: universities, start-ups, classrooms, hospitals, non-profits, government bureaus, corporations, restaurants, grocery stores, and professional associations are some of many examples of organizations.\n\nOrganizations are as varied and complex as they are ubiquitous: they differ in size and internal structure; they can entail a multiplicity of goals and tasks (some of which are planned and others unplanned!); they are made up of individuals whose goals and motivations may differ from those of the group; and they must interact with other organizations and deal with environmental constraints in order to be successful. This complexity frequently results in a myriad of problems for organizational participants and the organization’s survival.\n\nIn this course, we will use organizational theories to systematically analyze how an organization operates and can best be managed. Organizational theories highlight certain features of an organization’s structure and environment, as well as its processes of negotiation, production, and change. Each provides a lens for interpreting novel organizational situations and developing a sense for how individual and group behaviors are organized. Theories are valuable for the analyst and manager because most organizational problems are unique to the circumstances and cannot be solved by simple rules of thumb. Armed with a toolset of organizational theories, you will be able to systematically identify important features of an organization and the events transforming it; choose a theoretical framework most applicable to the observed mode of organizing; and use that theory to determine which actions will best redirect the organization in desired directions.\n\nIn sum, the course has three goals: to become familiar with a series of real-world organizational phenomena; to learn different theoretical perspectives that can elucidate these phenomena; and to apply these different ways of “seeing” and managing organizations to cases. In such a fashion, the course is designed to actively bridge theory and practice, exposing students to a variety of conceptual tools and ways to negotiate novel situations.", "slug": "coursera-organizational-analysis", "provider": "Coursera", "universitiesInstitutions": "Stanford University", "parentSubject": "Business", "childSubject": "Business Intelligence", "category": "Business Intelligence", "url": "https://www.coursera.org/learn/organizational-analysis", "length": 10.0, "language": "English", "credentialName": "", "rating": 4.3333333333333, "numberOfRatings": 9, "certificate": 1.0, "workload": ""}, {"courseId": 460, "courseName": "Introduction to Computational Finance and Financial Econometrics", "courseDescription": "Learn mathematical and statistical tools and techniques used in quantitative and computational finance.

How are some genes activated and others are silenced? How is this controlled? The answer is epigenetics.  \n\nEpigenetics has been a hot topic for research over the past decade as it has become clear that aberrant epigenetic control contributes to disease (particularly to cancer). Epigenetic alterations are heritable through cell division, and in some instances are able to behave similarly to mutations in terms of their stability. Importantly, unlike genetic mutations, epigenetic modifications are reversible and therefore have the potential to be manipulated therapeutically. It has also become clear in recent years that epigenetic modifications are sensitive to the environment (for example diet), which has sparked a large amount of public debate and research.\n\nThis course will give an introduction to the fundamentals of epigenetic control. We will examine epigenetic phenomena that are manifestations of epigenetic control in several organisms, with a focus on mammals. We will examine the interplay between epigenetic control and the environment and finally the role of aberrant epigenetic control in disease.\n\nAll necessary information will be covered in the lectures, and recommended and required readings will be provided. There are no additional required texts for this course. For those interested, additional information can be obtained in the following textbook.\n\nEpigenetics. Allis, Jenuwein, Reinberg and Caparros.

These systems underlie core subcellular processes such as signal transduction, transcription, motility and electrical excitability. In turn these processes come together to exhibit cellular behaviors such as secretion, proliferation and action potentials. What are the properties of such subcellular and cellular systems? What are the mechanisms by which emergent behaviors of systems arise? What types of experiments inform systems-level thinking? Why do we need computation and simulations to understand these systems?\n\nThe course will develop multiple lines of reasoning to answer the questions listed above.

We present specific case studies of this new scholarship of discovery divided into two stand-alone parts, which means that students can take any part without prior or subsequent attendance of the other part.\n\nPart 1 (this course) focuses on comparative inequality and opportunity and addresses two related questions ‘Who rises to the top?’ and ‘Who gets what?’.\n\nPart 2 (https://www.coursera.org/learn/understanding-china-history-part-2) turns to an arguably even more important question ‘Who are we?’ as seen through the framework of comparative population behavior - mortality, marriage, and reproduction – and their interaction with economic conditions and human values. We do so because mortality and reproduction are fundamental and universal, because they differ historically just as radically between China and the West as patterns of inequality and opportunity, and because these differences demonstrate the mutability of human behavior and values.\n\nCourse Overview video: https://youtu.be/dzUPRyJ4ETk", "slug": "coursera-understanding-china-1700-2000-a-data-analytic-approach-part-1", "provider": "Coursera", "universitiesInstitutions": "The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "parentSubject": "Humanities", "childSubject": "History", "category": "History", "url": "https://www.coursera.org/learn/understanding-china-history-part-1", "length": "", "language": "English", "credentialName": "", "rating": 4.5, "numberOfRatings": 2, "certificate": 1.0, "workload": "3-4 hours a week"}, {"courseId": 521, "courseName": "Jazz Improvisation", "courseDescription": "Learn the basic concepts of improvisation from Gary Burton, one of the most renowned improvisers in the jazz world, including the mental, melodic, and harmonic processes that contribute to the instinctive skills that an improviser puts to use when taking a solo.\n\nWhile many people are fans of jazz and understand that musicians are often “making up” the notes they are playing during a performance, most people—often including musicians, themselves, who are beginning to learn improvising—aren’t clear about what exact processes take place to enable this to happen.

Albums are made in bedrooms as well as studios. On the surface this is liberating. Anyone can make an album for the low cost of a couple pieces of gear and a software package. But, if you dig deeper, you will find that it is not so easy. Producing music requires knowledge, dedication, and creativity.\n    \nKnowledge is where this course comes in. No matter what kind of music you are making, there is a large set of tools that you will need to use.  Each lesson of this course will demonstrate a different set of music production tools, loosely following along the music production process of recording, editing, and mixing. \n\nWe will start with some background on the nature of sound and how we perceive it. We will then examine the components necessary to record audio into a computer, so that you understand the devices that sound must travel through in a music production process. \n    \nOnce recorded, sound must be organized along a timeline, a process known as editing. It allows us to give the impression of perfect performances and create many of the sounds we hear in contemporary music. The contemporary editing tool is the Digital Audio Workstation (DAW),  a piece of software that stores and organizes all the assets of a musical project. We will focus on the editing tools that are essential in contemporary music production and that all DAWs provide. \n\nAfter editing, sounds must be combined or mixed together, so we look to the mixing board—a very creative place if you know how to use it. We will explore the basic functionality of both hardware and software mixing boards, including volume, pan, mute, solo, busses, inserts, sends, and submixes. The mixing process, however, includes more tools than the mixing board provides on its own. Sound must also be processed, modified from its recorded state to fit the context of the music. We will look at compression, equalization, and delay, and examine the many audio effects that are offshoots of these devices and how they are used in a musical context.\n    \nIn the end, the music production process relies on your creativity. Creativity is a product of the mind and will stay there, unexpressed, until the right tools are used in the right way to share it with the world. If you have an idea in your head, it will take numerous steps, each with an important tool, to reach your audience.

The ability to process image and video signals is therefore an incredibly important skill to master for engineering/science students, software developers, and practicing scientists.   Digital image and video processing continues to enable the multimedia technology revolution we are experiencing today. Some important examples of image and video processing include the removal of degradations images suffer during acquisition (e.g., removing blur from a picture of a fast moving car), and the compression and transmission of images and videos (if you watch videos online, or share photos via a social media website, you use this everyday!), for economical storage and efficient transmission. \n\nThis course will cover the fundamentals of image and video processing.

For many musicians, he represents a kind of holy grail: His music has an intensity, rigor, and profundity which keep us in its thrall, and it is perhaps unequalled in the interpretive, technical, and even spiritual challenges it poses to performers. At the same time, Beethoven’s music is casually familiar to millions of people who do not attend concerts or consider themselves musically inclined. Two hundred years after his death, he is everywhere in the culture, yet still represents its summit.\n\nThis course takes an inside-out look at the 32 piano sonatas from the point of view of a performer. Each lecture will focus on one sonata and an aspect of Beethoven’s music exemplified by it. (These might include: the relationship between Beethoven the pianist and Beethoven the composer; the critical role improvisation plays in his highly structured music; his mixing of extremely refined music with rougher elements; and the often surprising ways in which the events of his life influenced his compositional process and the character of the music he was writing.) The course will feature some analysis and historical background, but its perspective is that of a player, not a musicologist.

Some of the questions we will address include: How did Einstein come up with his ideas? What was the nature of his genius? What is the meaning of relativity? What’s “special” about the special theory of relativity? Why did the theory initially seem to be dead on arrival? What does it mean to say that time is the “fourth dimension”? Can time actually run more slowly for one person than another, and the size of things change depending on their velocity? Is time travel possible, and if so, how? Why can’t things travel faster than the speed of light? Is it possible to travel to the center of the galaxy and return in one lifetime? Is there any evidence that definitively confirms the theory, or is it mainly speculation? Why didn’t Einstein win the Nobel Prize for the theory of relativity?\n\nAbout the instructor: Dr. Larry Lagerstrom is the Director of Academic Programs at Stanford University’s Center for Professional Development, which offers graduate certificates in subjects such as artificial intelligence, cyber security, data mining, nanotechnology, innovation, and management science.

We see tinkering as a serious endeavor—one that is generalizable across content and especially good at interweaving disciplines in a way that leads to complex projects and individualized learning opportunities. Tinkering has recently been introduced into the educational field as a potential driver of creativity, excitement, and innovation in science learning. It is seen by many as an effective means to engage in exploring STEM concepts, practices and phenomena. Tinkering typically blends the high and low tech tools of science along with a strong aesthetic dimension that supports children’s (and adults) self expression.\n\nFor over a decade, the Exploratorium has been developing science-rich tinkering activities for both children and adults. We see tinkering as a fun yet serious endeavor—spanning many disciplines and content areas and fostering connections between art, science, and technology. Learners follow their own path to understanding by investigating tools and materials and exploring questions that interest them. This opens up a wide range of possible answers rather than any “right” one, particularly for teaching STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) subjects in the classroom. This course centers on circuit-related activities, which offer a wealth of opportunities for thinking through making.\n\nIn this course, we won’t just show you how we develop tinkering activities; we’ll also delve into why. We’ll focus on three important aspects: activity design around specific materials, facilitation strategies, and environmental organization. We’ll also share some guiding principles and learning indicators we’ve developed that can help you integrate tinkering into your elementary and middle-school science program. Whether you’re new to making or a seasoned tinkerer, we hope this course will help you take the next step!\n\nOUR APPROACH TO TEACHING\n\nThis is a hands-on workshop, not a lecture-based class. Participation is essential! We want everyone to be making and tinkering together: trying things out, asking questions, sharing ideas, and reflecting together as a community. This is a wonderful chance to tinker and learn alongside people from all over the world and from all walks of life, so don’t be shy!\n\nPLEASE NOTE: Although this course will not have active instructor participation, we have put a great deal of effort towards creating a supportive space that encourages exploration. We’ll give you a few ways to get started; prompt you to share your own observations and experience as learners, designers and facilitators; and hopefully spark interesting conversations and discoveries along the way. While it’s not a requirement, we encourage you to take this class with a friend or colleague or meet with other people in your area: having support or doing activities with others will enhance your experience and help you stay engaged.\n\nREQUIRED COURSE MATERIALS\n\nYou will need several tools and materials to do weekly course activities. Pre-bundled materials are available from the Exploratorium store at www.artoftinkering.com. Please obtain all materials as soon as possible, well in advance of when you will need them in the course. Be sure to allow extra time for shipping and, if you are outside the U.S., for customs. In some cases, certain items may require assembly.

Highlighting the latest research in genetics and more, we will delve into the inner lives of plants and draw parallels with the human senses to reveal that we have much more in common with sunflowers and oak trees than we may realize. We’ll learn how plants know up from down, how they know when a neighbor has been infested by a group of hungry beetles, and whether they appreciate the music you’ve been playing for them or if they’re just deaf to the sounds around them. We’ll explore definitions of memory and consciousness as they relate to plants in asking whether we can say that plants might even be aware of their surroundings. This highly interdisciplinary course meshes historical studies with cutting edge modern research and will be relevant to all humans who seek their place in nature. \n\nThis class has three main goals: 1. To introduce you to basic plant biology by exploring plant senses (sight, smell, hearing, touch, taste, balance). 2. To introduce you to biological research and the scientific method. 3.

We spend six weeks studying three Platonic dialogues - \"Euthyphro\", \"Meno\", \"Republic\" Book I - then two weeks pondering a pair of footnotes to Plato: contemporary moral theory and moral psychology. \n\nPlatonic? Socratic? Socrates was the teacher, but he said he never did. Plato was the student who put words in his teacher's mouth. You'll get a feel for it.\n\nWe have a book: the new 4th edition of \"Reason and Persuasion\", by the instructor (and his wife, Belle Waring, the translator.) It contains the Plato you need, plus introductory material and in-depth, chapter-length commentaries. (Don't worry! John Holbo knows better than to read his book to the camera. The videos cover the same material, but the presentation is different.) \n\nThe book is offered free in PDF form - the whole thing, and individual chapter slices. It is also available in print and other e-editions. See the course content for links and information.\n\nThe course is suitable for beginning students of Plato and philosophy, but is intended to offer something to more advanced students as well. We seek new, odd angles on old, basic angles. Tricky! The strategy is to make a wide-ranging, interdisciplinary approach.  Lots of contemporary connections, to make the weird bits intuitive; plus plenty of ancient color, still bright after all these years. So: arguments and ideas, new possibilities, old stories, fun facts. Plus cartoons. \n\nThe results can get elaborate (some book chapters and some lesson videos run long.) But each video comes with a brief summary of its contents. The lessons progress. I put them in this order for reasons. But there's no reason you can't skip over and around to find whatever seems most interesting. There are any number of self-contained mini-courses contained in this 8-week course. You are welcome to them.\n\nPlato has meant different things to different people. He's got his own ideas, no doubt. (Also, his own Ideas.) But these have, over the centuries, been worn into crossing paths for other feet; been built up into new platforms for projecting other voices. (Plato did it to Socrates, so fair is fair.)

Why use C# instead of C++, Java, ActionScript, or some other programming language you may have heard of? First, using C# lets us use the open-source MonoGame framework, which help us quickly develop games for Windows, Android, iOS, Mac OS X, and others. Second, the Unity game engine is very popular with indie game developers, and C# is one of the programming languages you can use in the Unity environment. And finally, C# is a really good language for learning how to program.\n\nThat learning how to program comment is important because this course doesn't assume you have any previous programming experience. Don't worry if you've never written code before; we'll start at the very beginning and work our way up to building a small, complete game by the end of the course. Throughout the course you'll learn core programming concepts that apply to lots of programming languages, including C#, and you'll also learn how to apply those concepts when you develop games: drawing all the entities in the game world, updating the game world based on user input and simple physics, playing music and sound effects in your games, and so on.\n\nComputer programming is really fun in general, and programming games is even better!\n\nCaution: Beginning (assuming no prior programming knowledge) is not the same as easy (not hard to do).

With the ratification of the Paris Agreement, many countries have acceded to act in combatting climate change. Indeed, without climate action, decades of sustainable development is at risk, thus making this a ‘make or break’ point in time. Showcasing the most recent scientific evidence, explaining the different regional impacts and divulging climate action strategies, along with interactive tools such as a Carbon Footprint Tracker and (I) NDC Platform, this MOOC provides some opportunities, where you can take action on climate change.\n\nAbout the Course\n\nThis action-oriented MOOC gives you the opportunity to learn about regional climate change impacts and sector-specific strategies to increase resilience and move towards a low-carbon future. You will have the opportunity to explore these issues in depth and tailor your learning experience for one or more of the following regions:\n\n•  Latin America and Caribbean\n•  Sub-Saharan Africa\n•  Middle East and North Africa\n•  Eastern Europe and Central Asia\n•  East Asia and Pacific\n•  South Asia\n\n In this endeavor, the MOOC brings together renowned scientists and policymakers to provide a synthesis of the most recent scientific evidence on climate change, regional low emissions and climate resilient development strategies across sectors. A team of expert Instructors will lead discussions around the Paris Agreement, reflections from COP22 and the progress on Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).\n\nCourse Syllabus\n\nOverview \n\n‘From Climate Science to Action’ is divided into four weeks. The first two weeks will provide a comprehensive overview of the scientific evidence for climate change, followed by region-specific insights on the impacts of a warmer world in the 21st century. The last two weeks will focus on action strategies that are being undertaken in different regions and countries to meet the climate challenge, and how you as an individual can take action to avoid a warmer world!\n\nWeek 1:  Climate Change in the 21st Century\n\n•  Historical and projected observed changes in the climate system, leading up to the end of the 21st century\n•  The potential of Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) submitted at COP 21 from 187 countries to induce climate action\n•  Trends in climate change impacts, including loss of Arctic sea ice, melting glaciers, increased heat waves and extreme temperatures, and drought and aridity \n•  Possible responses from natural systems, explaining how warming could result in sea-level rise, heat waves and extreme temperatures, and ocean acidification\n\nWeek 2: Sectoral and Regional Impacts\n\n•  Impacts on key development sectors—from warming above pre-industrial temperatures and projected climate trends—across each of the world’s regions\n•  Sectoral impacts focusing on agricultural production, water resources, ecosystem services, and coastal vulnerability for affected populations \n•  Importance of risks with the potential to reverse hard-won development gains and potentially trap millions in poverty, illustrating the need for urgent action now\n\nWeek 3: From Science to Action on Climate Change\n\n•  Region-specific discussions on mitigation actions needed to reduce emissions while decreasing vulnerability to climate change impacts through adaptation and by building climate resilience\n•  Perspectives from regional experts on their experiences in strategies and actions proposed in each region to help transition towards a low-emissions, climate-resilient development path \n•  Discussions on the progress of the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), outcomes of the Paris Agreement and reflections from the Conference of Parties (COP)22\n\nWeek 4: What You Can Do\n\n•  Transformative impact of day-to-day changes when brought to a global scale\n•  The rationale for acting now, acting together and acting differently\n•  Examples and expected benefits of mitigation and adaptation policies, considering both contributions to global emission reductions and local development opportunities\n\nIn addition to the core resources and assignments, you may choose to go further, engaging in fun optional exercises, networking, discussion, and diving deeper into our rich selection of supplemental resources. You will have the opportunity to explore these issues in depth and tailor your learning experience for one or more of the following regions:\n\n•  Latin America and Caribbean\n•  Sub-Saharan Africa\n•  Middle East and North Africa\n•  Eastern Europe and Central Asia\n•  East Asia and Pacific\n•  South Asia\n\nCourse Format\n\nThis MOOC has a week-by-week structure, with resources, activities and exercises for you to engage in during each of the four weeks of the course. Each week, you will find a variety of course material, including: \n\n•  Interactive video talks by renowned climate scientists and practitioners \n•  Interactive tools: the Carbon Footprint Tracker, (I) NDC platform\n•  Resources: Core, optional (deep dive) and fun interactives on the week’s theme\n•  Quizzes that check your knowledge, reinforce the lesson’s material and provide immediate feedback\n•  Assignments that will sharpen your skills of analysis, reflection and communication\n•  Discussion forums and social media that enable collaboration with others from around the world, enriching interaction among participants\n•  As a final project, you will create a digital artifact \n\nYou can also go much further than this, engaging in optional exercises, networking, or discussion forums and dive deeper into our rich selection of additional resources. We also will use e-discussions, and other tools to facilitate dialogue between the learners and experts.\n\nRecommended Background: No background knowledge is necessary.

We present their histories, their philosophical underpinnings, their transformations in the modern global world, and we give you a chance to reflect upon meditation practices through secular contemplations designed just for this course. \n\nWe use a traditional, if overly simplistic, way of grouping Buddhist philosophical systems and ritual-contemplative practices into “three vehicles”, three programs of theory and practice supporting the personal journey from suffering to enlightenment. This scheme became normative in India and Tibet: (i) the Lesser Vehicle (Hīnayāna), (ii) the Great Vehicle (Mahāyāna), and (iii) the Adamantine Vehicle (Vajrayāna), also referred to as “esoteric Buddhism” or “Buddhist tantra”. To this, we will add a fourth Vehicle which is explicit in many Tibetan materials, though no standard term ever emerged that was accepted by all sectarian traditions - we will thus term it as the “Natural Vehicle” or “Post Tantra”. We follow an indigenous Tibetan tradition in terms of characterizing each with a specific orientational paradigm - repression, refinement, transformation, and natural freedom. These twelve meditative traditions constitute the framework for the course’s discussion of the main streams of Tibetan Buddhist meditation.\n\nThe five modules of the present course, dedicated to \"Lesser Vehicle\" practices and perspectives, treat the first five of these twelve types. Each module in turn has four components: (i) the specific Buddhist meditation in its traditional presentation and practice; (ii) modern scientific research into its efficacy and dynamics, or on practices, principles, and processes related to this type of meditation in our analysis; (iii) the fact, problems, and opportunities of modern secular adaptations in a variety of educational, professional, and personal settings; and (iv) secular practices for experimentation, which are either direct adaptations or new practices designed to give an experiential sense of some of the principles underlying the Buddhist meditative practice.", "slug": "coursera-tibetan-buddhist-meditation-and-the-modern-world-lesser-vehicle", "provider": "Coursera", "universitiesInstitutions": "University of Virginia", "parentSubject": "Humanities", "childSubject": "Religion", "category": "Religion", "url": "https://www.coursera.org/learn/buddhist-meditation", "length": 6.0, "language": "English", "credentialName": "", "rating": 3.2608695652174, "numberOfRatings": 23, "certificate": 1.0, "workload": "4-6 hours a week"}, {"courseId": 1343, "courseName": "Age of Jefferson", "courseDescription": "This course provides an overview of Thomas Jefferson's work and perspectives presented by the University of Virginia in partnership with Thomas Jefferson’s Monticello.

But “under the hood,” your brain must figure out even the simplest of details about the world around you and your position in it.  Recognizing your mother, finding your phone, going to the grocery store, playing the banjo – these require careful sleuthing and coordination across different sensory and motor domains.  This course traces the brain’s detective work to create this sense of space and argues that the brain’s spatial focus permeates our cognitive abilities, affecting the way we think and remember.\n\nThe material in this course is based on a book I've written for a general audience.  The book is called \"Making Space: How the Brain Knows Where Things Are\", and is available from Amazon, Barnes and Noble, or directly from Harvard University Press. \n\nThe course material overlaps with classes on perception or systems neuroscience, and can be taken either before or after such classes.\n\nDr. Jennifer M. Groh, Ph.D.\nProfessor\nPsychology & Neuroscience; Neurobiology\nDuke University\n www.duke.edu/~jmgroh\n\nJennifer M. Groh is interested in how the brain process spatial information in different sensory systems, and how the brain's spatial codes influence other aspects of cognition.  She is the author of a recent book entitled \"Making Space:  How the Brain Knows Where Things Are\" (Harvard University Press, fall 2014).\n\nMuch of her research concerns differences in how the visual and auditory systems encode location, and how vision influences hearing.  Her laboratory has demonstrated that neurons in auditory brain regions are sometimes responsive not just to what we hear but also to what direction we are looking and what visual stimuli we can see.  These surprising findings challenge the prevailing assumption that the brain’s sensory pathways remain separate and distinct from each other at early stages, and suggest a mechanism for such multi-sensory interactions as lip-reading and ventriloquism (the capture of perceived sound location by a plausible nearby visual stimulus).\n\nDr. Groh has been a professor at Duke University since 2006.  She received her undergraduate degree in biology from Princeton University in 1988 before studying neuroscience at the University of Michigan (Master’s, 1990), the University of Pennsylvania (Ph.D., 1993), and Stanford University (postdoctoral, 1994-1997).  Dr. Groh has been teaching undergraduate classes on the neural basis of perception and memory for over fifteen years.  She is presently a faculty member at the Center for Cognitive Neuroscience and the Duke Institute for Brain Sciences at Duke University.  She also holds appointments in the Departments of Neurobiology and Psychology & Neuroscience at Duke.\n\nDr. Groh’s research has been supported by a variety of sources including the John S.

You may be a member of a global online community, or a development aid worker collaborating with an international network of partner organizations. In all of these contexts, your effectiveness as a leader depends on how well you understand and are able to manage individual and collective behaviors in an intercultural context. \n\nIn this course – together with a team of Bocconi expert faculty and Bocconi alumni – we’ll explore the theory and practice of international and intercultural leadership and organizational behavior. Social science research has revealed systematic ways in which our behavior differs across cultural contexts – enabling us to more effectively work across borders. Insights from psychology, neuroscience, sociology and anthropology, from communication studies and from management scholarship allow us to understand what shapes individual and group decision making, what enhances or weakens team performance, and how we can build and use our social networks. And the shared practical experience of international leaders allows us to identify concrete steps to enhancing intercultural leadership competence, and to be cognizant of common leadership challenges.\n\nLearning about organizational behavior provides a great opportunity to develop your leadership skills and to reflect on your own behavioral tendencies. How do you usually make important decisions? What motivates you and how do you try motivating others? How successfully do you leverage and integrate diverse skills and views in a team? Do you prefer professional relationships with a close-knit group of trusted colleagues, or with a far-flung network of acquaintances from all walks of life?\n\nIf you really want to learn how organizations behave and take decisions and at the same time develop leadership skills, then this is the course for you.\n\nWe are looking forward to welcoming you and supporting you on this journey of learning and discovery. \n\nCOURSE SYLLABUS\nWeek 1 - Leadership Acumen.

This figure represents about 3.5% of the annual World GDP from 2007 to 2030.\n\nThe European Commission estimated, that by 2020, Europe will need between 1.5 - 2 trillion Euros in infrastructure investments. Between 2011 and 2020, about 500 billion Euros will be required for the implementation of the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) program, 400 billion Euros for Energy distribution networks and smart grids, 200 billion Euros on Energy transmission networks and storage, and 500 billion Euros for the upgrade and construction of new power plants. An additional 38 - 58 billion Euros and 181 - 268 billion Euros in capital investment will be needed to achieve the targets set by the European Commission for broadband diffusion.\n\nTraditionally investments in infrastructure were financed using public sources. However, severe budget constraints and inefficient management of infrastructure by public entities have led to an increased involvement of private investors in the business. \n\nThe course focuses on how private investors approach infrastructure projects from the standpoint of equity, debt, and hybrid instruments. \n\nThe course concentrates on the practical aspects of project finance: the most frequently used financial techniques for infrastructure investments. The repeated use of real life examples and case studies will allow students to link the theoretical background to actual business practices.\n\nIn the end of the course, students will be capable of analyzing a complex transaction, identifying the key elements of a deal, and suggesting proper solutions for deal structuring from a financial advisor's perspective.\n\nCourse Format\nThe course will consist of lecture videos, readings, and talks given by guest speakers.

Governments are viewed as public agencies set to correct market failures. Such agencies however are prone to failures of their own, and hence markets and governments are two imperfect alternatives. We deal with government's limitations, with particular emphasis on those that have to do with informational asymmetry, limited administrative capacity, and imperfect accountability to society.

Neuroscience, when allied with psychology and economics, creates powerful new models to explain why we make decisions. Neurobiological mechanisms of decision-making, decisions under risk, trust and cooperation will be central issues in this course. You will be provided with the most recent evidence from brain-imaging techniques (fMRI, TMS, etc.) and introduced to the explanatory models behind them.\n\nThe course does not require any prior study of economics and neuroscience; however, it might require you to study novel interdisciplinary materials.

You will also learn how to protect yourself and your organization against such forces lurking in the dark.\n\nAbout the Course\n\nThis course teaches how narrow frames and strong contexts can push good people towards unethical decisions and how they can protect themselves and their organization against ethical blindness.\n\nThe goal of this course is to empower the participants to analyze the risks of unethical or illegal behavior that might be triggered by powerful contexts. It draws from various disciplines such as management, psychology, sociology, philosophy, and literature, in order to learn what these disciplines contribute to a better understanding of unethical behavior. The course also analyzes some of the most prominent organizational scandals of the recent decades through the lenses of these disciplines.\n\nWhenever we hear about ethical scandals, we tend to believe that unethical or illegal behaviour in organizations is driven by character deficiencies of individual actors. Put differently, we simply assume that bad things are done by bad people. However, numerous corporate scandals have demonstrated that even people with a high level of integrity can break the rules if they are put into a strong context.\n\nA better understanding of why and under what conditions good people make bad ethical decisions will enable us to better protect individuals as well as their respective organizations against the potentially overwhelming power of the context. It will also enable us to cure societies from problems like corruption.\n\nAt the end of the course, you are able to:\n\n1.    Explain the impact of social context on individual decision making using various theories (from Management, Sociology, Psychology, and Philosophy) \n2.    Apply these theories to the analysis of some of the most eminent organizational scandals of the recent decades \n3.    Assess risks of ethical blindness in your own organizational context \n4.    Design interventions to reduce such risks for yourself and your organization \n\n\nRecommended Background\n\nNo background expertise is required. The course is open for interested layperson as well as experts who work on related topics, be it as researchers or practitioners (e.g., compliance managers in corporations).\n\nWhy is this course important for me? \n\nCurrently, the understanding of why good people make unethical decisions is rather limited, related research is rather fragmented, and the management of such problems in organizations is overly simplistic, legalistic, and inadequate. Understanding contexts, including the dangers of routines, the mindlessness of our daily decisions, and the healing power of mindful decision-making routines is of increasing importance. In this course, you will learn the latest knowledge and the appropriate tool box for dealing with ethical challenges that you will face throughout your life!\n\nWhat do I need to follow this course? \n\nWe build bridges between various scientific disciplines and will familiarize you with those disciplines smoothly.

While some recovered from the destruction, others did not.  But none responded to political catastrophe by fashioning the kind of elaborate and enduring monument to their own downfall that we find in the Bible. Most conquered populations viewed their subjugation as a source of shame. They consigned it to oblivion, opting instead to extol the golden ages of the past.  The biblical authors in contrast reacted to loss by composing extensive writings that acknowledge collective failure, reflect deeply upon its causes, and discover thereby a ground for collective hope.  \n \nWorking through colorful biblical and ancient Near Eastern texts, and drawing on an array of comparative examples, the course illustrates the thoroughgoing manner with which biblical authors responded to defeat by advancing a demotic agenda that places the community at the center. The aim of the biblical authors was to create a nation, and they sought to realize this goal via a shared text, which includes stories and songs, wisdom and laws. This corpus of writings belongs, without a doubt, to humanity’s greatest achievements. Whereas the great civilizations of the Near East invested their energies and resources into monuments of stone that could be destroyed by invading armies, the biblical authors left a literary legacy that has been intensively studied until the present day. More important, these authors’ visionary response to defeat brought to light a radical new wisdom:  the notion that a people is greater than the state which governs it, and that a community can survive collapse when all of its members can claim a piece of the pie and therefore have a reason to take an active part in its collective life.", "slug": "coursera-the-bible-s-prehistory-purpose-and-political-future", "provider": "Coursera", "universitiesInstitutions": "Emory University", "parentSubject": "Humanities", "childSubject": "Religion", "category": "Religion", "url": "https://www.coursera.org/learn/bible-history", "length": 6.0, "language": "English", "credentialName": "", "rating": 4.90625, "numberOfRatings": 32, "certificate": 1.0, "workload": "2-4 hours a week"}, {"courseId": 1411, "courseName": "Leadership in 21st Century Organizations", "courseDescription": "Meet Jim Barton, the new CEO of Santa Monica Aerospace.

Three main topics are covered:  social choice theory (i.e., collective decision making and voting systems), mechanism design, and auctions.\n\nIn the first week we consider the problem of aggregating different agents' preferences, discussing voting rules and the challenges faced in collective decision making. We present some of the most important theoretical results in the area: notably, Arrow's Theorem, which proves that there is no \"perfect\" voting system, and also the Gibbard-Satterthwaite and Muller-Satterthwaite Theorems.  We move on to consider the problem of making collective decisions when agents are self interested and can strategically misreport their preferences. We explain \"mechanism design\" -- a broad framework for designing interactions between self-interested agents -- and give some key theoretical results. Our third week focuses on the problem of designing mechanisms to maximize aggregate happiness across agents, and presents the powerful family of Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanisms.

Most markets around the world do not look like Silicon Valley, and they never will. But there are other models to support new businesses. In transitioning markets (where entrepreneurs do not have much access to private sector financing), government officials, donors, and business leaders are experimenting with creative approaches to support the growth of entrepreneurs. Northeast Ohio, whose largest city is Cleveland, is one such community. During our time together in this course, we will be exploring some of these innovative approaches. \n\nA massive intervention of government and donor resources in Northeast Ohio has been in place for over ten years. In that time, Northeast Ohio has experienced success (including job creation and follow-on funding) with alternative methods of financing startups, but it has not been easy. Yes, some progress has been made, but whether or not they've hit on ultimate success has yet to be determined. A dynamic entrepreneurial ecosystem takes many years, even decades, to develop. Government officials and donors typically are looking for shorter term success with their support programs which makes long-term support for entrepreneurship challenging. \n\nDuring this course, we will hear from entrepreneurs who have launched products and services ranging from medical devices to LED lights to whiskey. You will learn how these entrepreneurs engaged with resources made available to them through a variety of programs and intermediary organizations. We have chosen to talk with many business people that are still in the process of developing their companies and whose ultimate success or failure is still to be determined. \n\nIn addition to learning about Cleveland's attempts to support entrepreneurship, you will also be hearing in the lectures from leaders in selected markets around the world including Greece, Vietnam, Tunisia, Argentina, Rwanda and China about how they are working to support the growth of start-up companies.\n\nOne of our goals is to learn from you how different communities around the world are approaching implementing strategies and methods to support businesses. Taking what we've learned from our examples in class, I will ask you to reflect on how to best grow entrepreneurship where you live. I am excited to use this global platform to create a dialogue where information flows in multiple directions. \n\nMost MOOCs rebroadcast professors’ lectures, but this course will be different.

It will challenge you to move outside of your existing comfort zone and to recognize the value of that exploration.  This course will help you understand the importance of diverse ideas, and to convey that understanding to others. \n\nThe principal learning activity in the course is a series of \"differents\" where you are challenged to identify and change your own cultural, habitual, and normal patterns of behavior. Beginning with a prompt, e.g. \"eat something different\", you will begin to recognize your own = limits and to overcome them. In addition, you are encouraged to understand that creativity is based on societal norms, and that by it's nature, it will differ from and be discouraged by society. In this course, the persistence of the creative person is developed through practice.

It will also be useful to trainee teachers, school leaders, teacher educators and curriculum and assessment specialists, providing them with an understanding of the challenges associated with teaching and assessment of 21st century skills.\n\nThis course explains the social and cognitive skills that are known as 21st century skills. It reviews how they can be represented in the curriculum, in terms of developmental progressions. It also explores how teachers can recognise these skills in students, how the level of skill of a learner can be assessed, and then how learners can be supported to develop their skill. \n\nIn this course we work through two detailed examples of 21st century skills. The first is collaborative problem solving, a 21st century skill which combines the capacities of collaboration, problem solving, critical thinking and communication. The second skill is a meta-cognitive skill of knowing how to learn in a MOOC. In each example, you will explore how to understand the nature of each skill from a teaching perspective, how to teach it, and how to assess it. These two examples show how any 21st century skill can be tackled in the classroom.\n\nThe approach to teaching and assessment in this course derives from the application of a developmental, evidence-based, clinical approach to teaching practice.

When it comes to health information, most Americans have the ability to read and write at the fifth-grade level. This inter-professional course aims to give health professionals the tools needed to improve upon their health literacy and communication skills.\n\nThis inter-professional course will help educate a variety of health professionals about health literacy efforts and improved communication skills. It will require your active participation in creating health literate interactions at various organizational levels. This course will provide the opportunity to reinforce existing opportunities to work together as a multidisciplinary team or fill a gap if you haven’t had an opportunity to do so yet!\n\nPlease copy and paste the following link into your browser to view our course overview video. http://tinyurl.com/jepeg5e \n\nUpon completion of the course, you will be able to:\n\n1.     Define health literacy and how it applies to all health disciplines. \n\n2.     List the varied factors that influence health literacy and health communication. \n\n3.     Identify who is affected by health literacy and health communication. \n\n4.     Recognize the consequences of limited health literacy and poor health communication. \n\n5.     Determine the stakeholders in health literacy and health communication. \n\n6.     Recognize the role of health literacy in meeting core health service across disciplines. \n\n7.      Apply strategies to improve health literacy at the group, organizational, community, and policy levels\n\nIn addition to these course objectives, it is key to the success of the student that participants understand their responsibilities of working as a part of an inter-professional health care team. The basis of patient-centered care and the foundation of the medical home model is that health professionals will learn and implement skills to meet the community’s health needs in the context of the community’s daily lives—which is their reality! That includes recognizing the social determinants of health, such as complex social, economic, environmental, and political factors, that impact both the public’s wellness and their health literacy, too.\n\nOne initial step – an optional but recommended prerequisite to beginning this online course – is to first complete the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s self-directed online training, “Health Literacy for Public Health Professionals”. It provides a good foundation about health literacy in three brief, interactive lessons which will take about 1.5-2 hours to complete.\n\nWe are also using the Institute of Medicine’s Roundtable on Health Literacy discussion paper, “Ten Attributes of Health Literate Health Care Organizations” as a guide.  This online course will assist its participants in understanding that health literacy needs to be an organizational value and embraced as part of the organization’s core business. \n\nA phrase that we often like to use is “help a person connect the dots”. By this we mean we need to make sure that understanding of health information exists. An example of this would be thinking if someone is advised they need to take a medication, or told they need to change daily choices and behaviors to improve health that it will simply happen as directed. But, there are many necessary steps, strategies, and skills in communication for the advice being given to actually happen.  Often, current health professionals and health care settings often assume that “one size fits all” when it comes to communicating health messages.  This course will focus on some approaches to becoming a health literate health care organization by using scenarios with actors based on patient experiences, by also letting patients share their experiences in their own words, and by offering suggestions for improvement in health communication.\n\nWe hope you join us and become an agent of change both in your own discipline and as a member of an inter-professional team in health care organizations going forward!", "slug": "coursera-health-literacy-and-communication-for-health-professionals", "provider": "Coursera", "universitiesInstitutions": "University of Nebraska", "parentSubject": "Health & Medicine", "childSubject": "Health Care", "category": "Health Care", "url": "https://www.coursera.org/learn/health-literacy", "length": "", "language": "English", "credentialName": "", "rating": 4.0, "numberOfRatings": 1, "certificate": 1.0, "workload": "3-6 hours a week"}, {"courseId": 2015, "courseName": "Risk and Opportunity: Managing Risk for Development", "courseDescription": "Risks are a part of our everyday lives.

This morning you got up and ate your breakfast, e.g., eggs, milk, bread, fresh fruits, and the like. After the breakfast, you drove your car to work or school. At your office, you used your computer, perhaps equipped with 27” LCD monitor. During your break, you drank a cup of coffee and played with your iPhone. So on and so forth. You probably take it for granted that you can enjoy all of these products. But if you take a closer look at how each of these products can be made and eventually delivered to you, you will realize that each one of these is no short of miracle. For example, which fruit do you like? Consider fresh strawberries. In order for the strawberries to be on your breakfast table, there must be numerous functions, activities, transactions, and people involved in planting, cultivating, delivering, and consuming strawberries. Moreover, all of these functions, activities, transactions, and people are connected as an integral chain, through which physical products like strawberries themselves and virtual elements such as information and communication flow back and forth constantly. By grouping related functions or activities, we have a supply chain, comprised of four primary functions such as supplier, manufacturer, distributor, and finally consumer. A supply chain is essentially a value chain. \n\nFor the society or economy as a whole, the goal is to maximize value, i.e., to create satisfactory value without spending too much. In order to create the maximum value for the strawberry supply chain, every participant in the chain must carry out its function efficiently. In addition, all of the members must coordinate with each other effectively in order to ensure value maximization. We have to face the same issues for almost all the products and services we take for granted in our everyday life, e.g., cars, hamburgers, haircuts, surgeries, movies, banks, restaurants, and you name it! \n\nIn this course, we want to understand fundamental principles of value creation for the consumers or the market. We try to answer questions like how the product or service is made, how the value-creating activities or functions are coordinated, who should play what leadership roles in realizing all these, and so on. As our course title hints, we approach all of these issues from a learning perspective, which is dynamic in nature and emphasizes long-term capability building rather than short-term symptomatic problem solving.", "slug": "coursera-supply-chain-management-a-learning-perspective", "provider": "Coursera", "universitiesInstitutions": "Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology", "parentSubject": "Business", "childSubject": "Strategic Management", "category": "Strategic Management", "url": "https://www.coursera.org/learn/supply-chain-management", "length": 10.0, "language": "English", "credentialName": "", "rating": 3.8333333333332997, "numberOfRatings": 6, "certificate": 1.0, "workload": "2-3 hours a week"}, {"courseId": 2066, "courseName": "e-Learning Ecologies: Innovative Approaches to Teaching and Learning for the Digital Age", "courseDescription": "For three decades and longer we have heard educators and technologists making a case for the transformative power of technology in learning. However, despite the rhetoric, in many ways and at most institutional sites, education is still relatively untouched by technology. Even when technologies are introduced, the changes sometimes seem insignificant and the results seem disappointing. If the print textbook is replaced by an e-book, do the social relations of knowledge and learning necessarily change at all or for the better? If the pen-and-paper test is mechanized, does this change the nature of our assessment systems? Technology, in other words, need not necessarily bring significant change. Technology might not even represent a step forward in education.\n\nBut what might be new? How can we use technologies to innovate in education?\n\nThis course explores seven affordances of e-learning ecologies, which open up genuine possibilities for what we call New Learning – transformative, 21st century learning:\n\n1. Ubiquitous Learning\n2. Active Knowledge Making\n3. Multimodal Meaning\n4. Recursive Feedback\n5. Collaborative Intelligence\n6. Metacognition\n7. Differentiated Learning\n\nThese affordances, if recognized and harnessed, will prepare learners for success in a world that is increasingly dominated by digital information flows and tools for communication in the workplace, public spaces, and personal life. This course offers a wide variety of examples of learning technologies and technology implementations that, to varying degrees, demonstrate these affordances in action.\n\n--------------------------------\nRecommended Background\n--------------------------------\n\nThis course is designed for people interested in the future of education and the \"learning society,\" including people who may wish to join education as a profession, practicing teachers interested in exploring future directions for a vocation that is currently undergoing transformation, and community and workplace leaders who regard their mission to be in part \"educative.\"\n\n--------------------------------\nTake this Course for Credit at the University of Illinois\n--------------------------------\n\nThis course has the same content and anticipates the same level of contribution by students in the e-Learning Ecologies course offered to graduate certificate, masters, and doctoral level students in the College of Education at the University of Illinois.\n\nOf course, in the nature of MOOCs many people will just want to view the videos and casually join some of the discussions.

The University has 47 700 students and 7 500 staff based in Lund, Sweden. Lund University unites tradition with a modern, dynamic, and highly international profile. With eight different faculties and numerous research centers and specialized institutes, Lund is the strongest research university in Sweden and one of Scandinavia's largest institutions for education and research. The university annually attracts a large number of international students and offers a wide range of courses and programmes taught in English. \n\nThe Faulty of Law is one of Lund University’s four original faculties, dating back to 1666. It is a modern faculty with an international profile, welcoming both international and Swedish students. Education, research and interaction with the surrounding community are the main focus of the Faculty’s work. The connection between the three is particularly apparent in the programmes and courses offered by the university, including the university’s MOOC course in European Business Law. The students get the chance to engross themselves in traditional legal studies, while interacting with both researchers and professionally active lawyers with qualifications and experience from various areas of law.\nThe faculty offers three international Masters: two 2-year Master’s programmes in International Human Rights Law and European Business Law, and a 1-year Master’s in European and International Tax Law. Students from around 40 countries take part in the programmes which offer a unique subject specialization within each field, with highly qualified researchers and professional legal practitioners engaged in the teaching. \n\nThe Master’s programme in European Business Law provides an in-depth understanding of both the practical and the theoretical aspects of business law within the European Union. The programme provides both general and specific knowledge of the European Union legal framework, which is necessary for students intending to work as legal advisors or business decision-makers. The programme is delivered in English and is open to students with at least a three year degree in Law (Bachelor, LL.B, or equivalent) who want to specialise in European economic and business law.\nThe MOOC course in European Business Law is a great course to start with for students intending to apply for the Master’s programme in European Business Law. Even though the MOOC course does not grant credits previous knowledge of the subject is considered upon admission to the master’s programme.

Through concrete data sets and easy to use software the course provides data science knowledge that can be applied directly to analyze and improve processes in a variety of domains.\n\nData science is the profession of the future, because organizations that are unable to use (big) data in a smart way will not survive. It is not sufficient to focus on data storage and data analysis. The data scientist also needs to relate data to process analysis. Process mining bridges the gap between traditional model-based process analysis (e.g., simulation and other business process management techniques) and data-centric analysis techniques such as machine learning and data mining. Process mining seeks the confrontation between event data (i.e., observed behavior) and process models (hand-made or discovered automatically). This technology has become available only recently, but it can be applied to any type of operational processes (organizations and systems). Example applications include: analyzing treatment processes in hospitals, improving customer service processes in a multinational, understanding the browsing behavior of customers using booking site, analyzing failures of a baggage handling system, and improving the user interface of an X-ray machine. All of these applications have in common that dynamic behavior needs to be related to process models. Hence, we refer to this as \"data science in action\".\n\nThe course explains the key analysis techniques in process mining. Participants will learn various process discovery algorithms. These can be used to automatically learn process models from raw event data. Various other process analysis techniques that use event data will be presented. Moreover, the course will provide easy-to-use software, real-life data sets, and practical skills to directly apply the theory in a variety of application domains.\n\nThis course starts with an overview of approaches and technologies that use event data to support decision making and business process (re)design. Then the course focuses on process mining as a bridge between data mining and business process modeling. The course is at an introductory level with various practical assignments.\n\nThe course covers the three main types of process mining.\n\n1. The first type of process mining is discovery. A discovery technique takes an event log and produces a process model without using any a-priori information. An example is the Alpha-algorithm that takes an event log and produces a process model (a Petri net) explaining the behavior recorded in the log.\n\n2. The second type of process mining is conformance. Here, an existing process model is compared with an event log of the same process. Conformance checking can be used to check if reality, as recorded in the log, conforms to the model and vice versa.\n\n3. The third type of process mining is enhancement. Here, the idea is to extend or improve an existing process model using information about the actual process recorded in some event log. Whereas conformance checking measures the alignment between model and reality, this third type of process mining aims at changing or extending the a-priori model. An example is the extension of a process model with performance information, e.g., showing bottlenecks. Process mining techniques can be used in an offline, but also online setting. The latter is known as operational support. An example is the detection of non-conformance at the moment the deviation actually takes place. Another example is time prediction for running cases, i.e., given a partially executed case the remaining processing time is estimated based on historic information of similar cases.\n\nProcess mining provides not only a bridge between data mining and business process management; it also helps to address the classical divide between \"business\" and \"IT\". Evidence-based business process management based on process mining helps to create a common ground for business process improvement and information systems development.\n\nThe course uses many examples using real-life event logs to illustrate the concepts and algorithms. After taking this course, one is able to run process mining projects and have a good understanding of the Business Process Intelligence field.\n\nAfter taking this course you should:\n- have a good understanding of Business Process Intelligence techniques (in particular process mining),\n- understand the role of Big Data in today’s society,\n- be able to relate process mining techniques to other analysis techniques such as simulation, business intelligence, data mining, machine learning, and verification,\n- be able to apply basic process discovery techniques to learn a process model from an event log (both manually and using tools),\n- be able to apply basic conformance checking techniques to compare event logs and process models (both manually and using tools),\n- be able to extend a process model with information extracted from the event log (e.g., show bottlenecks),\n- have a good understanding of the data needed to start a process mining project,\n- be able to characterize the questions that can be answered based on such event data,\n- explain how process mining can also be used for operational support (prediction and recommendation), and\n- be able to conduct process mining projects in a structured manner.", "slug": "coursera-process-mining-data-science-in-action", "provider": "Coursera", "universitiesInstitutions": "Eindhoven University of Technology", "parentSubject": "Data Science", "childSubject": "Data Mining", "category": "Data Mining", "url": "https://www.coursera.org/learn/process-mining", "length": 6.0, "language": "English", "credentialName": "", "rating": 4.3125, "numberOfRatings": 16, "certificate": 1.0, "workload": "4-6 hours a week"}, {"courseId": 2446, "courseName": "Nonlinear Dynamics 1: Geometry of Chaos", "courseDescription": "An advanced introduction to nonlinear dynamics, with emphasis on methods used to analyze chaotic dynamical systems encountered in science and engineering.

Do we need to create a list of all phone numbers to ensure that there are enough phone numbers for everyone? Is there a way to tell that our algorithm will run in a reasonable time before implementing and actually running it? All these questions are addressed by a mathematical field called Combinatorics.\n\nIn this course we discuss most standard combinatorial settings that can help to answer questions of this type. We will especially concentrate on developing the ability to distinguish these settings in real life and algorithmic problems. This will help the learner to actually implement new knowledge. Apart from that we will discuss recursive technique for counting that is important for algorithmic implementations.\n\nOne of the main `consumers’ of Combinatorics is Probability Theory. This area is connected with numerous sides of life, on one hand being an important concept in everyday life and on the other hand being an indispensable tool in such modern and important fields as Statistics and Machine Learning. In this course we will concentrate on providing the working knowledge of basics of probability and a good intuition in this area.

Our world is submitted to regular changes as organizations evolve, come and go. Understanding your memberships and attachments to organizations will help you act on your world. You'll learn how to evaluate the influence of organizations around you and how to transform your relationships to reach a stronger coherence.\n\nDo you feel sometime that the world around you is disorganized? Can you make sense of all the information at your reach and have an impact on this situation? Have you ever thought that this conundrum may be due to all the organizations that emerge, strive or wane, and disappear every day? \n\nOrganizations are ubiquitous, from clubs and associations to firms and public agencies. Organizations confer meaning to all of us, and our attachment and membership to organizations have a profound effect on all areas of our lives. But in our increasingly turbulent world, these organizations run the risk of disappearing or losing their legitimacy, steering a sense of pointlessness and absurdity.\n\nThis course develops an integrative approach to understanding organizations and their behaviors, termed ‘orgology’. It explains that organizations can act strategically to protect and renew the sense of membership and attachment of individuals. So doing, organizations that survive and thrive impose their logics of action onto society, thereby influencing what is legitimate or not.  \n\nIn turn, individuals, you, all of us, must reinterpret our multiple associations with organizations and contribute to reinforce or inhibit social evolutions. This new way of understanding organizations’ relationships with society results in reconsidering management and the role of individuals in building their future.\n\nThere is no prerequisite to this course, you are all welcome ! Students and people interested in the fields of management, sociology, strategy, economics leadership etc… will benefit a lot from this course.\n\nFor the session of this course starting on January 11th, Professor Rodolphe Durand will actively be participating and interacting with learners.

Buddha famously gave up his kingdom in search of happiness. Several Greek philosophers (from Aristotle to Epicurus and Plato to Socrates) had their own views on what it takes to be happy. And of course, we all have our own theories about happiness too.\n\nHow valid are our theories?\n\nUntil recently, if you wished for an answer to this question, you would've been forced to base it on discussions with spiritual leaders. Or, if you were lucky, you could've based it on late-night (and perhaps intoxicant-fueled) conversations with friends and family. Happily, all that has changed now. Over the past decade-and-a-half, scientists have gotten into the act big time. We now have a pretty good idea of what it takes to lead a happy and fulfilling life.\n\nThis course, based on the award-winning class offered both at the Indian School of Business and at the McCombs School of Business at The University of Texas at Austin, developed by Prof. Raj Raghunathan (aka \"Dr. Happy-smarts\") draws content from a variety of fields, including psychology, neuroscience, and behavioral decision theory to offer a tested and practical recipe for leading a life of happiness and fulfillment. \n\nAlthough not mandatory, reading Prof. Raj's forthcoming book, titled If you're so smart, why aren't you happy? can help you review and assimilate the material covered in this book at your leisure. \n\nFor Coursera learners alone, the hardcover version of the book is available for a deep discount of 50%, plus shipping and handling. You can order the hardcover for 50% off by writing to Aaron at: Aaron@800ceoread.com.

Researchers try to make sense of these large urban areas using a variety of concepts. The class will review debates and present social science models of cities to analyse and compare contemporary developments.\nGlobalization, Europeanization processes support the rapid developments of cities in different part of the world. Urbanization is reaching a new high in the contemporary world with the rise of mega cities (beyond 15 million inhabitants) such as Calcutta, Los Angeles, Dhaka, Cairo, Tokyo, New York, Shanghai, Mexico or Seoul. Beyond the modern metropolis, researchers try to make sense of these large urban areas using a variety of concepts such as the ‘postmetropolis’, ‘global cities’, and ‘global city-regions’. The class will review debates and present social science models of cities and metropolis to analyse and compare contemporary developments. How can do we study those cities when they become mega urban regions, does size matter and for what? Do we see the making of a vast urban world or by contrast beyond the apparent convergence of complex globalisation processes understood in relation to globalised capitalism, is it possible to identify masked differentiations and the strengthening of different urban worlds? How do we make sense of this urban world when cities are not independent units but have to be understood both in terms of territories, rootedness, and at the same time in terms of relations to take into account flux, mobility, circulations ? What is the relevance of social science concepts developed in the Western world to analyse the transformation of Lagos? To what extent may the systematic development of new forms of comparison between northern cities and cities from the South change social sciences and contribute to overcome the bias towards national comparison? \nFor the time being, given current conditions of capitalism, political, economic, cultural and social questions are increasingly becoming urban questions. In the modern conception of the world/globalcity, characterised by size, the aggregation of housing, differentiated divisions of labour, and the density of interaction, several conceptions of cities exist which have become entangled and sometimes opposed to each other. These different conceptions underline different processes of integration: the material city of walls, squares, houses, roads, light, utilities, buildings, waste, and physical infrastructure; the cultural city in terms of imaginations, differences, representations, ideas, symbols, arts, texts, senses, religion, and aesthetics; the politics and policies of the city in terms of domination, power, government, mobilisation, public policies, welfare, education; the social city of riots, ethnic, economic and gender inequalities, everyday life and social movements; and the economy of the city : the division of labour, scale, production, consumption, trade.....\nClassic urban questions about inequalities, housing, government, integration, are combined with issues about the urban fabric, questions of mobility and rootedness, sustainable development and risks, the making of the cyborg cities, questions of social control and riots, urban culture, innovation and urban economic development.\n\nAll video produced by Sciences Po for this Mooc are under Creative Commons (BY / NC / SA)\n\nRecommended Background\nThe course is designed for undergraduates but it also will interest graduates and professionals concerned in urban issues.\n\nThe course is organized in 8 sequences and displays multimedia contents (images, video, original documents).

We’ll divide this fascinating journey into six hands-on projects that will take you from constructing elementary logic gates all the way through creating a fully functioning general purpose computer. In the process, you will learn - in the most direct and constructive way - how computers work, and how they are designed.\n\nWhat you’ll need:\nThis is a self-contained course: all the knowledge necessary to succeed in the course and build the computer system will be given as part of the learning experience. Therefore, we assume no previous computer science or engineering knowledge, and all learners are welcome aboard. You will need no physical materials, since you will build the computer on your own PC, using a software-based hardware simulator, just like real computers are designed by computer engineers in the field. The hardware simulator, as well as other software tools, will be supplied freely after you enroll in the course.\n\nCourse format:\nThe course consists of six modules, each comprising a series of video lectures, and a project. You will need about 2-3 hours to watch each module's lectures, and about 5-10 hours to complete each one of the six projects. The course can be completed in six weeks, but you are welcome to take it at your own pace. You can watch a TED talk about this course by Googling \"nand2tetris TED talk\".\n\n*About Project-Centered Courses: Project-centered courses are designed to help you complete a personally meaningful real-world project, with your instructor and a community of learners with similar goals providing guidance and suggestions along the way.

As the future leaders and drivers of growth, productivity and innovation, young people are our greatest assets, and investment in their health and wellbeing has social, economic and other benefits that continue across the lifespan and into the next generation.\n\nIn this course we will adopt a life-course framework to take a holistic view of youth health and wellbeing. We will explore changing patterns of adolescent health and development, including why adolescence is starting earlier and ending later; how puberty and adolescent brain development may shape future health; and how what happens in adolescence can affect the start to life for the next generation. We’ll also look at the major health and social issues affecting young people and ways of addressing these through policy, practice and programming.\n\nCOURSE FORMAT:\nThis course comprises short video lectures and interviews, required and recommended readings, online discussion, quizzes and written assignments. There is no required text for this course and all readings are provided.\n\nDO I HAVE TO PAY FOR THIS COURSE?\nNo- you may access 100% of material in this course for free. You are also welcome to do as much or as little of the course as you like, including all (or none!) of the assessment tasks- it all depends on your learning goals. The option to pay for this course is there for those who wish to receive a Course Certificate as evidence of completion (which does require you to attempt and successfully pass the assessment tasks). \n\nWHO IS THIS COURSE FOR?\nThis course will be relevant for anyone with an interest in the health and wellbeing of young people. You do not need to be of any particular personal or professional background to benefit from this course, but having some basic undergraduate study experience will be helpful to your learning (particularly if in a health related field).\n\nWHAT IS THE MOST INTERESTING THING I'LL LEARN IF I TAKE THIS COURSE?\nYou’ll learn how so much of what happens during adolescence can impact not only the future health of individuals, but the health of the next generation as well. You’ll develop a greater understanding of the key factors impacting upon youth health and learn how to be a better advocate for the health and wellbeing of young people.\n\nView the MOOC promotional video here: http://tinyurl.com/z5l4mod", "slug": "coursera-global-adolescent-health", "provider": "Coursera", "universitiesInstitutions": "University of Melbourne", "parentSubject": "Health & Medicine", "childSubject": "Public Health", "category": "Public Health", "url": "https://www.coursera.org/learn/youth-health", "length": "", "language": "English", "credentialName": "", "rating": 0.0, "numberOfRatings": 0, "certificate": 1.0, "workload": "4-6 hours a week"}, {"courseId": 3334, "courseName": "Introduction to Statistics for the Social Sciences", "courseDescription": "This course exposes students to the logic of statistical reasoning and its application in the quantitative social sciences.

An understanding of these issues helps inform a comprehensive and multi-sectorial response for preventing and responding to GBV. \n\nModule 2 – Health Care Response, Screening, and Psychosocial Support\nRecognition of health impacts of GBV has led to calls to address GBV within the health sector. Support for GBV survivors extends beyond clinical exam and assessment. Safety planning, harm reduction, and access to psychosocial support must be ensured. \n\nModule 3 – Clinical Care for GBV Survivors\nCaring for GBV survivors requires compassionate, confidential, and nondiscriminatory clinical assessment. Competent medical and forensic examination, along with appropriate documentation, is essential.\n\nHonors Module – In-Depth Information and Special Topics\nThis module provides additional materials for those who wish to explore specialized topics and gain a more advanced grasp of the complexities of addressing gender-based violence. Core course topics are expanded upon, and special populations and programs are highlighted. Special topics include violence in humanitarian settings, against adolescents and sex workers, and human trafficking.

For five hundred years, the privilege of being able to publish was enjoyed by very few people – those who had access to a printing press or a radio microphone or a television camera. Now, almost anyone can publish to the world within minutes of being able to do so. But is it journalism?\n\nHow does a citizen journalist find things out, so they can report facts and news - moving beyond merely braying opinion? And what are the legal and ethical pitfalls to publishing facts that some people might prefer remain secret?\n\nOver six weeks, this course teaches the basics of news writing, how to interview people to gain crucial information, how to develop and manage your sources and how to use your legal rights to access public information - and stay on the right side of the law when you publish. We discuss the ethics behind journalism practice, and conduct a mock investigation into local government.

The treatment is mathematical, but only for the purpose of clarifying the formulation. The emphasis is on coding up the formulations in a modern, open-source environment that can be expanded to other applications, subsequently.\n\nThe course includes about 45 hours of lectures covering the material I normally teach in an\nintroductory graduate class at University of Michigan. The treatment is mathematical, which is\nnatural for a topic whose roots lie deep in functional analysis and variational calculus. It is not\nformal, however, because the main goal of these lectures is to turn the viewer into a\ncompetent developer of finite element code. We do spend time in rudimentary functional\nanalysis, and variational calculus, but this is only to highlight the mathematical basis for the\nmethods, which in turn explains why they work so well. Much of the success of the Finite\nElement Method as a computational framework lies in the rigor of its mathematical\nfoundation, and this needs to be appreciated, even if only in the elementary manner\npresented here. A background in PDEs and, more importantly, linear algebra, is assumed,\nalthough the viewer will find that we develop all the relevant ideas that are needed.\n\nThe development itself focuses on the classical forms of partial differential equations (PDEs):\nelliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic. At each stage, however, we make numerous connections to\nthe physical phenomena represented by the PDEs. For clarity we begin with elliptic PDEs in\none dimension (linearized elasticity, steady state heat conduction and mass diffusion). We\nthen move on to three dimensional elliptic PDEs in scalar unknowns (heat conduction and\nmass diffusion), before ending the treatment of elliptic PDEs with three dimensional problems\nin vector unknowns (linearized elasticity). Parabolic PDEs in three dimensions come next\n(unsteady heat conduction and mass diffusion), and the lectures end with hyperbolic PDEs in\nthree dimensions (linear elastodynamics). Interspersed among the lectures are responses to\nquestions that arose from a small group of graduate students and post-doctoral scholars who\nfollowed the lectures live. At suitable points in the lectures, we interrupt the mathematical\ndevelopment to lay out the code framework, which is entirely open source, and C++ based.\n\nBooks:\nThere are many books on finite element methods. This class does not have a required\ntextbook. However, we do recommend the following books for more detailed and broader\ntreatments than can be provided in any form of class:\n\nThe Finite Element Method: Linear Static and Dynamic Finite Element Analysis, T.J.R.\nHughes, Dover Publications, 2000.\n\nThe Finite Element Method: Its Basis and Fundamentals, O.C.

The famous Kaifeng Jewish community, which was established in Kaifeng, the Chinese capital of the Song Dynasty (960-1279), is but a best-known example. However, the largest Jewish Diaspora in China appeared in modern times. In over 100 years, from the mid-19th century to the mid-20th century, about 40,000 Jews came to China and lived in newly-established major port cities such as Hong Kong, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Harbin. Jewish communities composed of these Jews became an essential part of the economic and social life of those modern Chinese cities. What brought such a large number of Jews to China? Where did these people come from? How did they arrive? Were they all in China at the same time, and were there any differences among them? What happened to them after they arrived?

Tech progress is an important source of economic growth and raises broader questions about the human condition, including how culture evolves and who controls that evolution. Technology also matters in countless other ways as it often establishes the framework in which governments interact with their citizens, both in allowing speech and blocking it and in establishing exactly what the boundaries are between private life and the government.  And technology itself is powerfully shaped by the laws that apply in areas as diverse as copyright, antitrust, patents, privacy, speech law and the regulation of networks.\n\n The course will explore seven topics:\n\n 1.      Microsoft: The Desktop vs. The Internet. We will start with a look at the technology path that led to the first personal computer in early 1975, the Altair 8800. That path starts with the vacuum tube, moves to transistors, then to integrated circuits and finally to the microprocessor. We will look at the early days of software on the personal computer and the competition between selling software and open-source approaches as well as the problem of software piracy. We will discus the public good nature of software. The 1981 launch of the IBM PC revolutionized the personal computer market and started the path to Microsoft's powerful position and eventual monopoly in that market with the selection of MS-DOS. We then turn to four antitrust cases against Microsoft: (1) the 1994 U.S. case relating to MS-DOS licensing practices; (2) the U.S. antitrust middleware case over Microsoft’s response to Netscape Navigator; (3) the European Union case regarding Windows Media Player; and (4) the EU browser case over Internet Explorer. These disputes arose at the point of maximal competition between the free-standing personal computer and the Internet world that would come after it and we may know enough now to assess how these cases influenced that competition.\n\n 2.      Google Emerges (and the World Responds). Google has emerged as one of the dominant platforms of the Internet era and that has led to corresponding scrutiny by regulators throughout the world. Decisions that Google makes about its algorithm can be life altering. Individuals are finding it more difficult to put away past mistakes, as Google never forgets, and businesses can find that their sales plummet if Google moves them from the first page of search results to a later page. With great power comes scrutiny and we will look at how government regulators have evaluated how Google has exercised its power. Both the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the European Union have undertaken substantial investigations of Google’s practices and we will look at both of those.\n\n 3.      Smartphones. The Internet started on the desktop but the Internet is increasingly mobile and people are seemingly tethered to their smartphones and tablets. And we have seen an interesting shift in that market away from Nokia handsets and the Blackberry to Apple's iPhone and its iOS platform and to the Android platform. The legal infrastructure of smartphones and tablets is extraordinarily complex. We will start by looking at U.S. spectrum policy and the effort to free up 500 megahertz of spectrum. We will look at the activities of standard setting organizations, including the IEEE and the creation of the 802.11 standard and Wi-Fi (or, if you prefer, wifi), the creation of patent pools and the regulation of standard essential patents. We will look at the FTC action against Google/Motorola Mobility and Apple's lawsuit against Samsung over utility and design patents relating to the iPhone. Finally, we will take a brief look at the European Commission's investigation into the Android platform.\n\n 4.      Nondiscrimination and Network Neutrality. Facebook has more than 1 billion users and measure that against a world population of roughly 7 billion and a total number of Internet users of roughly 2.5 billion. A course on law and technology simply has to grapple with the basic framework for regulating the Internet and a key idea there is the notion of network neutrality. Nondiscrimination obligations are frequent in regulated network industries, but at the same, discrimination can be an important tool of design for communication networks. We will start our look at the Internet by looking at the great first communications network of the United States, the post office and will look in particular at the Post Office Act of 1845.   We will then move to modern times and will consider efforts by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission to produce sensible and sustainable nondiscrimination conditions for the Internet and will touch briefly on comparisons from around the world.\n\n 5.      The Day the Music Died? In many ways, the Internet came first to music with the rise of peer-to-peer (p2p) music sharing through Napster and its successors. We start with a look into music platform history and the devices that brought recorded music into the home: the phonograph and the player piano. We turn to radio and the legal regime that puts music on the airwaves, the performing rights organizations like ASCAP and BMI. We look at the antitrust issues associated with the blanket license. We consider a failed music platform, digital audio tape, and the complicated legal regime associated with it, the Audio Home Recording Act of 1992. We will consider the copyright issues raised by the creation and distribution of music and the litigation over the p2p technologies such as Napster and Grokster. The music industry responded to p2p technology by adding digital rights management tools to CDs. As music distribution switched from physical media to digital distribution, we entered the world of Apple and the iPod and iTunes. We consider the DRM issues associated with Apple's music platform as seen by Steve Jobs. We conclude by looking at emerging subscription services like Spotify and the service that Apple is building based on its purchase of Beats.\n\n 6.      Video: Listening and Watching. Images are some of the most powerful ways in which ideas and speech are communicated and video has long been regulated by the state. That starts as a communications law issue with government regulation of the radio spectrum, but also leads to the design of the television system with the assignment of channels and eventually the definition of digital television. And with the emergence first of cable TV and subsequently the VCR critical copyright roadblocks had to be overcome for new distribution technologies to emerge. We will consider the legal engineering that led to the DVD platform, which was an exercise in patent pools and trademark creation. We will sort through the creation of the digital TV platform and will also look at the copyright underpinnings for Netflix. And we will consider the question of technology neutrality in the content of the copyright fight over a new video distribution entrant, Aereo. Finally, we close the week with a brief look at the incentive spectrum auctions and the possible end of broadcast television.\n\n 7.      The Mediated Book. Gutenberg revolutionized books with his printing press and for academics, books are sacred objects. But the printed book is on the run and with the rise of the ebook, we are entering a new era, the era of the mediated book. This is more than just a change in technology. We will look at the issues created by the rise of the ebook, issues about control over content and licensing and of the privacy of thought itself. We will also look at the legal skirmishes over this space, including the copyright fair use litigation over Google Books, the Apple e-book antitrust case. And we will look at the Amazon Kindle platform.", "slug": "coursera-internet-giants-the-law-and-economics-of-media-platforms", "provider": "Coursera", "universitiesInstitutions": "The University of Chicago ", "parentSubject": "Social Sciences", "childSubject": "Law", "category": "Law", "url": "https://www.coursera.org/learn/internetgiants", "length": 9.0, "language": "English", "credentialName": "", "rating": 4.6666666666667, "numberOfRatings": 3, "certificate": 1.0, "workload": "3-6 hours a week"}, {"courseId": 3588, "courseName": "Contemporary India ", "courseDescription": "This course presents some important vignettes of a complex, highly diverse India that is also witnessing unprecedented changes since its formal independence in 1947 from Great Britain.

This course will facilitate your learning process to engage in changing practices to make them more sustainable, responsible, and ethically informed.\n\nWe will first introduce the context of the trend towards responsible management practices (week 1). We then explore the basics of each set of issues, sustainability (week 2), responsibility (week 3), and ethics (week 4). In week 5 you will work on your own responsible management issue/task and explore responsible management practices in an area of professional interest (e.g. strategy, entrepreneurship, innovation, organization, operations, supply chain, human resources, marketing and communication, international management, accounting and finance). In week 6 we will try to understand and experience what managing responsibly means in practice, including opportunities and challenges, and with a focus on transformative change. During these last two weeks you will work in a problem-oriented way, based on a challenging topic you have come across in your own management practice.\n\nIn the course we will form multicultural teams to learn about problems you bring forward. The course also facilitates the formation of peer networks that allow you to continue this learning experience after finishing the MOOC. The MOOC is an initiative in collaboration with the UN-supported Principles for Responsible Management Education (PRME) initiative.\n\nOverall Learning Outcomes\n1) To provide an introduction to the three constituting fields of managing responsibly: sustainability, responsibility and ethics.\n2) To help apply the knowledge and insights gained from these three fields to real life problems in your own setting.\n3) To identify, understand and facilitate individual action that can lead to change at the organisational and system level ...to ‘act is to move’\n4) To learn to appreciate and bring together different points of view, and negotiate collective solutions to pressing problems.\n\nWho is this MOOC for?

We also look at the origins, views, backgrounds and relations among leaders, and how those leaders make decisions about public policy and try to get those decisions implemented down through the system. China has few formal institutions through which citizens can participate in politics, but we will study the strategies Chinese people use to try to influence their leaders’ decisions. Finally, we assess China’s future and whether rapid economic development and the emergence of a vibrant middle class will push China towards greater democracy or whether the single party system is likely to survive into the future.

In this approach, we will develop the concepts you need to know from experimental observations and scientific reasoning rather than simply telling you the concepts and then asking you to simply memorize or apply them.\n\nSo why use this approach? \n\nOne reason is that most of us are inductive learners, meaning that we like to make specific observations and then generalize from there.  Many of the most significant concepts in Chemistry are counter-intuitive.  When we see where those concepts come from, we can more readily accept them, explain them, and apply them. \n\nA second reason is that scientific reasoning in general and Chemistry reasoning in particular are inductive processes.  This Concept Development approach illustrates those reasoning processes.  \n\nA third reason is that this is simply more interesting! The structure and reactions of matter are fascinating puzzles to be solved by observation and reasoning.  It is more fun intellectually when we can solve those puzzles together, rather than simply have the answers to the riddles revealed at the outset.\n\nRecommended Background: \nThe class can be taken by someone with no prior experience in chemistry.  However, some prior familiarity with the basics of chemistry is desirable as we will cover some elements only briefly.  For example, a prior high school chemistry class would be helpful.\n\nSuggested Readings:\nReadings will be assigned from the on-line textbook “Concept Development Studies in Chemistry”, available via Rice’s Connexions project.

Did you know that one glass of milk provides a 5-year old child with 21% of his/her daily protein requirements and 8% of their energy needs?\n\nMost milk in the world, about 85%, is produced from cattle. However, water buffaloes, goats, sheep, and camel are also dairy animals. The United States, India, the European Union, Brazil, and New Zealand are among the largest dairy producers in the world. Yet among these dairy-producing countries there are varied methods to generate milk with highly variable productivity and efficiency. Dairy production is vital for the survival of billions of people. Globally, around 150 million small-scale dairy households, equivalent to 750 million people, are engaged in milk production. The number and size of dairy farms varies among countries, but in India alone, there are estimated 78 million dairy farms! In the United States, one of the leading milk-producing countries in the world, total milk production has been steadily increasing in the last decades, reaching over 205 billion pounds (93 billion kilograms) in 2014. This was accompanied by a steady increase in average milk yield per cow, reaching 22,260 lb (over 10,100 kg) per lactation in 2014. How has this efficiency been achieved? What methods are necessary to ensure production of high quality milk? How do we balance milk production efficiency with animal health and environmental protection? This course will provide the student with information to better understand dairy production systems and their role in feeding the world population.\n\nIn this MOOOOO-C, you will learn about the dairy enterprise from internationally recognized dairy science professors who have delivered highly regarded dairy education programs within the United States and internationally.\n\nCourse lectures are translated into Portuguese and Chinese; PDF files of these translations can be found under each course week.

Today, more than 3.9 billion people, making up more than 54% of the global population, live in cities. Urbanization is expected to continue in the coming years, raising the urban population to 6.0 billion by 2045. This dramatic increase in urban populations will inevitably increase the demand for energy, mobility (transportation), water, and other urban services in every city around the world. Without functional governance and management structures that ensure efficient, resilient and sustainable performance in cities, the current urbanization growth might become a catastrophic risk threatening the quality of life of the humanity.\n\nSustainable development in 21st century can only be realized by introducing innovations in both management and operations of urban infrastructures systems. Developing management practices that effectively integrates the processes of urban planning with urban infrastructures planning and management is a challenging goal that many cities are struggling with  nowadays, but is a must for transforming cities to sustainable and resilient engines of growth in both developing and developed economies. \nThis course will provide you with the basic principles of urban infrastructure management that are fundamental for building prosperous cities that are sustainable, resilient and efficient. \n\nIn order to obtain a certificate for this course, the participants have to pass four graded quizzes and complete four mandatory assignments, plus a final exam. In addition to the graded assignments students have the option to write a 7-10 page peer-reviewed case study about management of energy OR transportation system in their city (on your own choice). \nThe best case studies will be also evaluated by our jury at IGLUS and the authors of the 3 best case studies will win a full tuition fee waiver scholarship to enroll in the IGLUS professional training program in Spring 2017. \n\nYou can also pre-enroll in our upcoming MOOC on Smart Cities now.

In this course, you will learn about modeling and solving performance problems in a fashion popular in theoretical computer science, and generally train your abstract thinking skills.   \n\nAfter finishing this course, you have learned to think about the behavior of systems in terms of token production and consumption, and you are able to formalize this thinking mathematically in terms of prefix orders and counting functions. You have learned about Petri-nets, about timing, and about scheduling of token consumption/production systems, and for the special class of Petri-nets known as single-rate dataflow graphs, you will know how to perform a worst-case analysis of basic performance metrics, like throughput, latency and buffering.\n\nDisclaimer: As you will notice, there is an abundance of small examples in this course, but at first sight there are not many industrial size systems being discussed. The reason for this is two-fold. Firstly, it is not my intention to teach you performance analysis skills up to the level of what you will need in industry. Rather, I would like to teach you to think about modeling and performance analysis in general and abstract terms, because that is what you will need to do whenever you encounter any performance analysis problem in the future. After all, abstract thinking is the most revered skill required for any academic-level job in any engineering discipline, and if you are able to phrase your problems mathematically, it will become easier for you to spot mistakes, to communicate your ideas with others, and you have already made a big step towards actually solving the problem. Secondly, although dataflow techniques are applicable and being used in industry, the subclass of single-rate dataflow is too restrictive to be of practical use in large modeling examples. The analysis principles of other dataflow techniques, however, are all based on single-rate dataflow.

Scarcity means that society must develop some allocation mechanism – rules to determine who gets what. Over recorded history, these allocation rules were usually command based – the king or the emperor would decide. In contemporary times, most countries have turned to market based allocation systems. In markets, prices act as rationing devices, encouraging or discouraging production and encouraging or discouraging consumption in such a way as to find an equilibrium allocation of resources. We will construct demand curves to capture consumer behavior and supply curves to capture producer behavior. The resulting equilibrium price “rations” the scarce commodity. Markets are frequent targets of government intervention. This intervention can be direct control of prices or it could be indirect price pressure through the imposition of taxes or subsidies. Both forms of intervention are impacted by elasticity of demand. \n\nAfter this course, you will be able to: \n•\tDescribe consumer behavior as captured by the demand curve.\n•\tDescribe producer behavior as captured by the supply curve.\n•\tExplain equilibrium in a market.\n•\tExplain the impact of taxes and price controls on market equilibrium.\n•\tExplain elasticity of demand.\n•\tDescribe cost theory and how firms optimize given the constraints of their own costs and an exogenously given price.\n\nThis course is part of the iMBA offered by the University of Illinois, a flexible, fully-accredited online MBA at an incredibly competitive price.

We will begin by understanding equilibrium under a market structure called Perfect Competition, a benchmark construction. Economists have tools to measure the efficiency of market outcomes. We next consider the polar extreme of a competitive market: a monopoly market. We will determine the monopoly equilibrium price and quantity and efficiency properties. Much economic activity takes place in markets with just a handful of very large producers. To understand equilibrium in these oligopoly markets requires more careful attention to strategic interdependence. To capture this interdependence, we consider collusive arrangements among a small number of rivals as well as the use of simple game theoretic techniques to model equilibrium. Market Failure describes situations where markets fail to find the efficient outcome. Information asymmetries are one fertile form of market failure. Another form of market failure occurs when externalities are present. We will examine one key externality, pollution, and construct a policy prescription to mitigate the negative efficiency impacts of this externality.\n\nUpon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:\n•\tExplain how different market structures result in different resource allocations.\n•\tModel the impact of external shocks to a particular market structure and demonstrate the new equilibrium price and quantity after the impact of this external shock has played out.\n•\tEvaluate the efficiency of an equilibrium.

Next, we distinguish between the short run, when prices trends are relatively rigid, and the long run, when prices are fully flexible. We first focus on the short run equilibrium of the market for aggregate goods and services, taking into account the feedback from aggregate income to aggregate demand and vice versa. We then combine the result with the money market equilibrium derived in Part 1 and characterize the macroeconomic equilibrium that determines income, interest rate, exchange rate, and unemployment rate in the short run. We use this model to analyze the short-run consequences of monetary and fiscal policies. In our next step, we examine how income, exchange rate, and inflation rate are determined in the long run.

To achieve this goal, this course will rely on a multidisciplinary approach that allow you to see how different disciplines get into a single object, in different perspectives and in often complementary ways. This approach will also allow us to appreciate the complexity of a subject like doping.\n\nDoping in sports is a complex practice whose definition and identification is the result of socially and historically constructed norms.\nThis course offers to shed light on the processes that led to the use and prohibition of doping substances. Performance enhancement or physical transformation are two aspects of doping which are seen as problematic, yet even as we speak companies are making fortunes selling body improvement and other forms of “human enhancement” to us. These apparent contradictions will be analysed to show that beyond sanitary questions, doping raises many social, scientific and legal issues. \nIn efforts to control doping, governments and sports authorities have put into place institutions responsible for defining what falls into the category of doping, but also what prevention, repressions and research methods to put into effect. This course will also explore biological control measures such as the biological passport, key legal dimensions, organisations that produce performance, as well as the sociological dimensions of doping.\n\nBesides the Professors of University of Lausanne, the best experts of doping are involved in this course: experts from an Anti-doping Laboratory (LAD- Lausanne-Switzerland), from the CAS (Court of Arbitration for Sport), from the UEFA (soccer), and from the WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency).\n\nTeaser:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20Q3eR_g7rU\n\nMain Learning Outcomes\n\nAt the end of the course the participants will be able to :\n\n1.\tIdentify the “cultural” dimension of doping,  that is as a historical practice linked to the transformation of social norms,\n2.\tGo from a binary way of thinking - for or against doping - to an understanding of the complexity of this phenomenon which is biological, psychological and sociological, all at the same time,\n3.\tRecognize the institutions, the actors and the practices of the fight against doping,\n4.\tExplain how the social and organisational context influences individuals decisions and how this influence can be reduced by effective prevention measures,\n5.\tIdentify how the fight against doping is led and how testing is carried out.", "slug": "coursera-doping-sports-organizations-and-sciences", "provider": "Coursera", "universitiesInstitutions": "University of Lausanne", "parentSubject": "Humanities", "childSubject": "Sports", "category": "Sports", "url": "https://www.coursera.org/learn/doping", "length": 4.0, "language": "English", "credentialName": "", "rating": 0.0, "numberOfRatings": 0, "certificate": 1.0, "workload": ""}, {"courseId": 5280, "courseName": "The Holocaust - An Introduction (I): Nazi Germany: Ideology, The Jews and the World", "courseDescription": "The Holocaust was an inconceivable historical event, which forever robbed Western culture of its innocence.

The first module develops a model of macroeconomy in the short run when the price level has its own momentum and does not respond much to supply and demand forces. The model enables one to see how GDP, interest rate, and exchange rate are determined in the short run and how they respond to macroeconomic shocks and policies.\n\nThe second module starts the analysis of long-run equilibrium by examining the foreign exchange market. It then connects the long-run outcome with expectations about the future trends in the exchange rate at each moment, which constitute a key driver of the spot exchange rate in the short run. The methodology developed for this purpose can be applied to expectations concerning other macroeconomic variables as well. Finally, the long-run foreign exchange model is employed to derive a number of important lessons for the long run trends in currency values and competitiveness of producers in various countries.\n\nThe third module examines the drivers of aggregate output in the long run and the mechanisms of adjustment from the short run to the long run. The model provides insights about why some countries are much richer than others and why some economies grow faster than others over decades. The analysis also sheds light on why inflation varies across countries or over time in the same country. The model is employed to analyze the sources of macroeconomic instability and the roles of fiscal and monetary policies in stabilization or destabilization of the macroeconomy.\n\nThe final module discusses the characteristics of desirable macroeconomic policies and the reasons why actual policies deviate from them. It connects these deviations to country characteristics that one needs to take into account when assessing a country’s long-term macroeconomic environment. The module ends with a discussion of the institutional conditions that help bring about better fiscal and monetary policies.\n\nAt the end of this course, you will be able to:\n•\tUnderstand how the market for aggregate goods and services interacts with the money market to shape the macroeconomic equilibrium that determines income, interest rate, and exchange rate in the short run.\n•\tUnderstand the links between the short-run and long-run processes.\n•\tAssess the dynamic effects of macroeconomic policies and understand the roles of globalization, government policies, institutions, and expectations in macroeconomic outcomes.\n\nThis course is part of the iMBA offered by the University of Illinois, a flexible, fully-accredited online MBA at an incredibly competitive price.

For instance, if one could write down the equations of motion for every atom in a system, it should be possible to solve those equations (with the aid of a sufficiently large computing device) and make accurate predictions about that system’s future.\n\nHowever, there are some systems that defy this notion. Consider a living cell, which consists mostly of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen along with other trace elements. We can study these components individually without ever imagining how combining them in just the right way can lead to something as complex and wonderful as a living organism! Thus, we can consider life to be an emergent property of what is essentially an accumulation of constituent parts that are somehow organized in a very precise way.\n\nThis course lets you explore the concept of emergence using examples from materials science, mathematics, biology, physics, and neuroscience to illustrate how ordinary components when brought together can collectively yield unexpected, surprising behaviors.\n\nNote: The fractal image (Sierpinkski Triangle) depicted on the course home page was generated by a software application called XaoS 3.4, which is distributed by the Free Software Foundation under a GNU General Public License.\n\nUpon completing this course, you will be able to:\n1.

Problems in public health and health policy tend to be complex with many actors, institutions and risk factors involved.

Systems  thinking is a core skill in public health and helps health policymakers build programs and policies that are aware of and prepared for unintended consequences.\n\nAn important part of systems thinking is the practice to integrate multiple perspectives and synthesize them into a framework or model that can describe and predict the various ways in which a system might react to policy change.

We recommend you sign up for a certificate as this course is on premium grading and you will only enjoy the full benefit of the project if you can join in with the assignments. In addition this course contains the exciting opportunity to research and analyze historical decisionmaking, international relations, business cases and battles  in an effort to truly understand constructing a convincing argument.\n\nMost important decisions in life, and many unimportant ones, are taken after some degree of reflection. If those decisions affect other people, we may take some advice and we might even follow it. The larger the issue and the greater number of people involved, the more likely that advice process will be institutionalised. Most of us tend to think of policy advice in the context of things as counsel to politicians in matters of national security or policy-making by governments. Of course, we also know that it takes place on a regular basis within businesses and other organisations. But it also happens in local politics and in local campaigns and in everyday life. Every time you try to influence someone’s decision, you are offering policy advice. Even if you are not planning to be an active advisor, the discipline of collecting and arranging the necessary materials is useful in all kinds of research and writing exercises. Writing a policy advice is what we call a ‘transferrable skill’.\n\nThe course requires an academic approach, but no previous experience. The projects can be completed by both novices and advanced learners. One thing is certain. Both groups will learn a lot from the experience. \n\nWhat is a policy advice?\nIn its simplest form, a policy advice is a short paper that argues your position on a particular issue and the course of action you propose. It also tries to convince the audience to adopt your position and to take action on your advice. \n\nWhat advice can I give?\nYou may well have a topic already, based on your work or your social situation. This could be a piece of equipment your firm might want to buy or a new market it might wish to enter. It could be a campaign for a local play area or against pollution in local ground-water. In this case it is a question of arranging and presenting your position, and discussing it with others in a similar position.\n\n On the other hand, you might be open for suggestions. In this case, we have prepared some topics covering business case studies, issues of current affairs, and historical examples. For example, you could look into the archives advise Harry Truman to adopt a different policy towards the Soviet Union at the start of the Cold War. Alternatively you could suggest advise the Incas in 1532 not to be so trusting in their dealings with the Spanish. After all, you will know the outcome. So the course should appeal to everyone interested in practical policy-making as well as amateur historians, strategy gamers. Everyone can have fun applying these techniques to their favourite topics.\n\nWhat will I learn?\nThe project-based course is designed so that you learn by doing rather than by listening. The assignments that you complete, the feedback that you receive and the assignments of others that you read and upon which you comment are all intrinsic parts of the course. The lectures are designed to act as signposts along the way and the readings allow you to explore some of the issues in greater depth. During the whole course experience you will learn to:\n•\tFrame a starting position for your own research\n•\tUse search engines to locate materials required for your advice\n•\tExplore ‘academic’ data-bases\n•\tAnnotate your sources correctly\n•\tTarget your research for statistical data\n•\tChoose a visualisation for your statistical data \n•\tConstruct an argument in a logical manner\n•\tBuild up the logic in each paragraph \n•\tConduct a SWOT analysis\n•\tConduct a Risk Analysis\n•\tPresent the materials in a position paper\n•\tConvert the position paper to a policy advice\n•\tRecognise the policy-making hierarchy and shaping the advice accordingly \n•\tWrite a powerful and effective PowerPoint presentation\n•\tPlace your project in the ‘real world’ context of the policy-cycle\n•\tAnd ... Discover a great, great deal about your chosen topic.\n\nHow much time will the course take?\nThe lecture materials in each module will themselves take no more than 30 minutes to view and review. Each module is accompanied by selected reading materials, but these are not compulsory. There is also a Skills Lab with extra literature and videos to assist you to improve your writing, computer and presentation skills. Combining these parts of the course, and assuming that you make some use of all the facilities offered, the ‘on-platform’ time should take no more than an one hour for each module. \nThe project-time depends on the degree of advancement in the project choice. If you come with a ready prepared idea and knowledge of the area, then the project-time should in total be approximately four to five hours. If you decide to use the suggestions in our collections, then you should add another three to four hours to familiarise yourself with the subject and the necessary materials. If you should decide to start a completely new project from scratch, the you would need to add another three hours or so to orient yourself in the problem and then locating the required materials.\n\nAbout Project-Centered Courses: Project-centered courses are designed to help you complete a personally meaningful real-world project, with your instructor and a community of learners with similar goals providing guidance and suggestions along the way.

These five time-tested models have been put to use by entrepreneurial superstars like Michael Dell, Bill Gates, Richard Branson and more. Sadly, though, the five models are rarely talked about and not widely understood. Until now! The five models will be brought to life by the real-world stories of an inspiring collection of incredibly creative entrepreneurs from around the world – including successes and failures – through a series of captivating no-holds-barred interviews with founders and others, and investors, too. \n\nWhy? \n\nMore than two generations ago, the venture capital community – VC’s, business angels, incubators, and others – convinced the entrepreneurial world that writing business plans and raising venture capital constituted the twin centerpieces of entrepreneurial endeavor. They did so for very good reasons: the sometimes astonishing returns they’ve delivered to their investors and the incredibly large and valuable companies their ecosystem has created. But the vast majority of fast growing companies never take any angel or venture funding. Are they onto something that most of today’s entrepreneurial ecosystem has missed? Indeed, should a business angel or VC be seen as the first port of call for getting your nascent entrepreneurial venture off the ground or growing it faster? Perhaps not. \n\nHow? \n\nYou’ll be asked to do a series of exercises – out in the real world – to put your growing toolkit to use in your business or the one you hope to start. Hands-on, practical tools to help your business start and thrive – without venture capital. You’ll join our discussion board of fellow participants, if you like, and learn from others who are putting the tools to work, just as you are. And to suit today’s fast-paced lifestyles, we’ve broken what you’ll get – short lessons, interviews, thought-provoking questions, even some optional things to read – into bite-sized chunks, so you can log in and grab them whenever and wherever you are.\n\nAnd what else?\n\nIf, after checking out and perhaps completing this course, you find your company in a position where seeking venture capital turns out to be the right thing to do next, John Mullins leads an inspiring and hands-on executive education course at London Business School – this one face-to-face – called Financing the Entrepreneurial Business. There, among a room full of investors and entrepreneurs, you’ll study a series of captivating real-world cases and learn everything an entrepreneur – or an investor, for that matter – needs to know to handle the person who sits across the deal table and take an entrepreneurial business from start-up to exit.

To appreciate, quite simply, means to value and to recognize that which has value—it is a way of knowing and valuing the best in life. In the language of Positive Organizational Scholarship it means a research focus—a positive bias—seeking fresh understanding of dynamics described by words like excellence, thriving, abundance, resilience, or exceptional and life-giving. \n\nIn this context the word appreciate means to value those things of value—it is a mode of knowing often connected to the idea of esthetic appreciation in the arts. To appreciate also means to be grateful or thankful for—it is a way of being and maintaining a positive stance along the path of life's journey. And not incidentally, to appreciate is to increase in value too. Combining the three—appreciation as a way of knowing, as a way of being and as an increase in value– suggests that Appreciative Inquiry is simultaneously a life-centric form of study and a constructive mode of practice.  As a form of study, Appreciative Inquiry focuses on searching systematically for those capacities and processes that give life and strength and possibility to a living system; and as a constructive mode of practice, it aims at designing and crafting human organizations through a process in which valuing and creating are viewed as one, and where inquiry and change are powerfully related and understood as a seamless and integral whole \n\nLeading Positive Change through Appreciative Inquiry is a course dedicated to advancing our understanding and skill in leading strength-based change and on how to create, foster and manage organizations in which people thrive and perform at their best.", "slug": "coursera-leading-positive-change-through-appreciative-inquiry", "provider": "Coursera", "universitiesInstitutions": "Case Western Reserve University", "parentSubject": "Business", "childSubject": "Management & Leadership", "category": "Management & Leadership", "url": "https://www.coursera.org/learn/appreciative-inquiry", "length": "", "language": "English", "credentialName": "", "rating": 0.0, "numberOfRatings": 0, "certificate": 1.0, "workload": ""}, {"courseId": 5849, "courseName": "Be a Leader, Develop a Leader", "courseDescription": "The objectives of this MOOC are to enable you to learn from applying concepts, exercises and learning from the four other MOOCs in this specialization.

The course is a joint Penn-UNICEF project, and it includes many examples of norms that sustain behaviors like child marriage, gender violence and sanitation practices. \n\nThis is Part 1 of the Social Norms, Social Change series. In these lectures, I introduce all the basic concepts and definitions, such as social expectations and conditional preferences, that help us distinguish between different types of social practices like customs, descriptive norms and social norms. Expectations and preferences can be measured, and these lectures explain how to measure them. Measurement is crucial to understanding the nature of the practice you are facing, as well as whether an intervention was or was not successful, and why.

Technical innovations in networks, sensors and applications, coupled with the advent of 'smart machines' have resulted in a huge diversity of devices generating all kinds of structured and unstructured data that needs to be processed somewhere.  Collecting and understanding that data, combining it with other sources of information and putting it to good  use can be achieved by using connectivity, analytical and cognitive services now available on the cloud, allowing development and deployment of solutions to be achieved faster and more efficiently than ever before.\n\nThis course is an entry level introduction to developing and deploying solutions for the Internet of Things. It will focus on capturing data from a trusted device and sending the data to a cloud platform where it can be exploited by the many services available. You will explore all the steps required to create a basic IoT solution using a popular device, the Raspberry Pi, and a trial version of the cloud-based IBM Watson IoT Platform. \n\nWhat you will learn: \nQuickly create applications that leverage connectivity and analytics as part of an integrated IoT platform.  Use Node-RED, an open-source visual application development environment, on both the device and the cloud.  Create a basic IoT solution by leveraging pre-built blocks of code that abstracts and speeds the development process. Use APIs to access the platform and explore the different connectivity options for various devices, gateways and applications. Explore options to ensure your solution makes best use of the captured data. \n \nWhat technology is required to complete the course?  \nThe programming assignments require you to have a Raspberry Pi device - any model of Raspberry Pi with a 40 pin header. The course also uses the SenseHAT extension board, whilst it is preferable to have a SenseHat there is a simulator provided if you can't get a SenseHAT.  \n\nYou will need internet connectivity to download software, connect to the platform, develop and deploy your IoT solution.\n\nYour Rasberry Pi will need the latest Rasbian Jessie OS. This OS will be on a Micro SD Card. The recommended size of the SD card is 8GB but 4GB will do. Note that the learner kit comes with a preconfigured SD card.\n\nIn order to setup the Micro SD card, you will need a computer with either a windows, apple or Linux OS. Since most computer do not have a micro SD port, you will need a Micro SD adapter or USB Micro SD card adapter. Your computer will also be used when working on the platform.\n\nTo work on your Raspberry Pi, you will need an HDMI monitor or TV to work as the display for the Raspberry Pi (DVI monitor will also work). To connect the monitor to the Raspberry Pi you will need an HDMI cable (or a DVI to HDMI cable).\nYour Raspberry Pi needs a way to connect to the internet; either an Ethernet cable for connecting to the Router, or a USB WiFi dongle if you have wireless connectivity. Note that the Raspberry Pi 3 includes built-in WiFi\nA USB Keyboard and mouse.\n\nYour Raspberry Pi will also needs a 5V micro USB power supply i(This may be a phone charger for example)\nThere is an IoT Learner kit available from element14 which includes the Raspberry Pi, a pre-flashed SD card, a case and power supply : https://www.element14.com/community/docs/DOC-82034/l/element14-iot-learner-kit \n\nWhat prerequisite skills are required ?\nThis is an entry level course, but does assume you have basic programming skills. The assignments set use both Python and JavaScript programming languages, so some basic skill in these languages is required. No previous experience with IBM Bluemix or the IBM Watson IoT Platform is required.\n\nWhat additional resources do I need for this course? \nThe Server side code for the assignments will use the IBM Bluemix cloud platform, so you will need to sign up for a free account on that platform.\n\nWhen your 30-day trial expires, you can enter a credit card to keep using Bluemix. Bluemix has a set amount of free resources available to users who have registered with their credit card. If you stay within these free resources limits you will not incur any charges. This is a good idea if you are planning to take longer than 30 days to complete the course, or if you have an existing trial account that that is about to expire and you need longer time on the platform to complete the course.", "slug": "coursera-a-developer-s-guide-to-the-internet-of-things-iot", "provider": "Coursera", "universitiesInstitutions": "IBM", "parentSubject": "Computer Science", "childSubject": "Internet of Things", "category": "Internet of Things", "url": "https://www.coursera.org/learn/developer-iot", "length": "", "language": "English", "credentialName": "", "rating": 4.0, "numberOfRatings": 1, "certificate": 1.0, "workload": ""}, {"courseId": 6041, "courseName": "ADHD: Everyday Strategies for Elementary Students", "courseDescription": "This course will provide an overview of ADHD diagnosis and treatment.

The students get the chance to engross themselves in traditional legal studies, while interacting with both researchers and professionally active lawyers with qualifications and experience from various areas of law.\nThe faculty offers three international Masters: two 2-year Master’s programmes in International Human Rights Law and European Business Law, and a 1-year Master’s in European and International Tax Law. Students from around 40 countries take part in the programmes which offer a unique subject specialization within each field, with highly qualified researchers and professional legal practitioners engaged in the teaching. \n\nThe Master’s programme in European Business Law provides an in-depth understanding of both the practical and the theoretical aspects of business law within the European Union. The programme provides both general and specific knowledge of the European Union legal framework, which is necessary for students intending to work as legal advisors or business decision-makers. The programme is delivered in English and is open to students with at least a three year degree in Law (Bachelor, LL.B, or equivalent) who want to specialise in European economic and business law.\nThe MOOC course in European Business Law is a great course to start with for students intending to apply for the Master’s programme in European Business Law. Even though the MOOC course does not grant credits previous knowledge of the subject is considered upon admission to the master’s programme.

Albums are made in bedrooms as well as studios. On the surface this is liberating. Anyone can make an album for the low cost of a couple pieces of gear and a software package. But, if you dig deeper, you will find that it is not so easy. Producing music requires knowledge, dedication, and creativity.\n    \nKnowledge is where this course comes in. No matter what kind of music you are making, there is a large set of tools that you will need to use.  Each lesson of this course will demonstrate a different set of music production tools, loosely following along the music production process of recording, editing, and mixing. \n\nWe will start with some background on the nature of sound and how we perceive it. We will then examine the components necessary to record audio into a computer, so that you understand the devices that sound must travel through in a music production process. \n    \nOnce recorded, sound must be organized along a timeline, a process known as editing. It allows us to give the impression of perfect performances and create many of the sounds we hear in contemporary music. The contemporary editing tool is the Digital Audio Workstation (DAW),  a piece of software that stores and organizes all the assets of a musical project. We will focus on the editing tools that are essential in contemporary music production and that all DAWs provide. \n\nAfter editing, sounds must be combined or mixed together, so we look to the mixing board—a very creative place if you know how to use it. We will explore the basic functionality of both hardware and software mixing boards, including volume, pan, mute, solo, busses, inserts, sends, and submixes. The mixing process, however, includes more tools than the mixing board provides on its own. Sound must also be processed, modified from its recorded state to fit the context of the music. We will look at compression, equalization, and delay, and examine the many audio effects that are offshoots of these devices and how they are used in a musical context.\n    \nIn the end, the music production process relies on your creativity. Creativity is a product of the mind and will stay there, unexpressed, until the right tools are used in the right way to share it with the world.

Internationally leading faculty experts will provide a historical perspective on HTMD, describe preparation of ‘library’ samples that cover hundreds or thousands of compositions, explain techniques for characterizing the library to determine the structure and various properties including optical, electronic, mechanical, chemical, thermal, and others.  Case studies in energy, transportation, and biotechnology are provided to illustrate methodologies for metals, ceramics, polymers and composites.\n\nThe Georgia Tech Institute for Materials (IMat) developed this course in order to introduce a broad audience to the essential elements of the Materials Genome Initiative.  Other courses will be offered by Georgia Tech through Coursera to concentrate on integrating (i) high-throughput experimentation with (ii) modeling and simulation and (iii) materials data sciences and informatics.\n\n\nAfter completing this course, learners will be able to \n•\tIdentify key events in the development of High-Throughput Materials Development (HTMD)\n•\tCommunicate the benefits of HTMDwithin your organization.\n•\tExplain what is meant by high throughput methods (both computational and experimental), and their merits for materials discovery/development. \n•\tSummarize the principles and methods of high throughput creation/processing of material libraries (samples that contain 100s to 1000s of smaller samples).\n•\tState the principles and methods for high-throughput characterization of structure.\n•\tState the principles and methods for high throughput property measurements.\n•\tIdentify when high-throughput screening (HTS) will be valuable to a materials discovery effort.\n•\tSelect an appropriate HTS method for a property measurement of interest.\n•\tIdentify companies and organizations working in this field and use this knowledge to select appropriate partners for design and implementation of HTS efforts.\n•\tApply principles of experimental design, library synthesis and screening to solve a materials design challenge.\n•\tConceive complete high-throughput strategies to obtain processing-structure-property (PSP) relationships for materials design and discovery.", "slug": "coursera-introduction-to-high-throughput-materials-development", "provider": "Coursera", "universitiesInstitutions": "Georgia Institute of Technology", "parentSubject": "Engineering", "childSubject": "", "category": "Engineering", "url": "https://www.coursera.org/learn/high-throughput", "length": "", "language": "English", "credentialName": "", "rating": 0.0, "numberOfRatings": 0, "certificate": 1.0, "workload": ""}, {"courseId": 6538, "courseName": "English for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics", "courseDescription": "Welcome to English for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics, a course created by the University of Pennsylvania, and funded by the U.S. Department of State Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, Office of English Language Programs.  \n\nTo enroll in this course for free, click on “Enroll now” and then select \"Full Course.

L'urbanisation atteint de nouveaux sommets aujourd’hui avec l'essor des mégacités (plus de 15 millions d'habitants) comme Calcutta, Los Angeles, Dhaka, Le Caire, Tokyo, New York, Shanghai, Mexico ou Séoul. Au-delà de la métropole moderne, les chercheurs tentent de donner un sens à ces grandes régions urbaines au moyen de concepts divers tels que « post-métropoles », « villes globales », et « régions métropolitaines globales ». Ce cours passera en revue les débats et les modèles de villes et métropoles actuels proposés par les sciences sociales afin d'en analyser et comparer les développements contemporains. Comment étudier ces villes quand elles deviennent des mégarégions urbaines, leur taille importe-t-elle et en quoi ? Assiste-t-on à la naissance d'un immense monde urbain ou, au contraire, au-delà de l'apparente convergence de processus de mondialisation complexes, compris dans leur relation avec le capitalisme mondial, est-il possible d'identifier des différenciations masquées et le renforcement de mondes urbains distincts ? Quel sens donner à ce monde urbain alors que les villes ne sont pas des unités indépendantes mais doivent être comprises non seulement en termes de territoires et d'enracinement mais également de relations, afin de prendre en compte les flux, la mobilité, les circulations ? Quelle pertinence peuvent avoir des concepts de sciences sociales développés en Occident pour l'analyse de la transformation de Lagos ? Jusqu'à quel point le développement systématique de nouvelles formes de comparaison entre les villes du Nord et du Sud peut-il faire évoluer les sciences sociales et contribuer à surmonter la tendance à privilégier les comparaisons entre nations ? \nPour l'instant, dans les conditions actuelles du capitalisme, les questions politiques, économiques, culturelles et sociales deviennent de plus en plus urbaines. Selon la conception moderne de la ville mondiale, caractérisée par la taille, par l'agrégation des logements, les divisions différenciées du travail, et la densité des interactions, plusieurs conceptions de la ville ont fini par s'entremêler et parfois s'opposer. Ces conceptions soulignent différents processus d'intégration : la ville matérielle et ses murs, ses places, ses maisons, ses routes, ses services, ses bâtiments, ses déchets, et son infrastructure physique ; la ville culturelle des imaginaires, des différences, des représentations, des idées, des symboles, des arts, des textes, des sens, des religions, et des esthétiques ; la politique et les politiques de la ville en termes de domination, de pouvoir, de gouvernement, de mobilisation, de politiques publiques, de sécurité sociale, d'éducation ; la ville sociale des révoltes, des inégalités ethniques, économiques et de genre, de la vie quotidienne et des mouvements sociaux ; et l’économie de la ville : la division du travail, l'échelle, la production, la consommation, le commerce.....\nLes questions urbaines classiques portant sur les inégalités, le logement, le gouvernement, l'intégration, se mêlent aux questions sur le tissu urbain, sur la mobilité et l'enracinement, sur le développement durable et les risques, sur l'apparition des villes « cyborg », sur le contrôle social et les émeutes, la culture urbaine, l'innovation, et le développement économique urbain.\nToutes les vidéos produites par Sciences Po pour ce MOOC sont sous licence Creative Commons (BY / NC / SA)\n\nPlan du cours\n\nSemaine #1 : Introduction, définitions, questions urbaines et l'utilisation de modèles\nSemaine #2 : Les villes européennes et le modèle d'intégration wébérien\nSemaine #3 : Les villes coloniales et post coloniales\nSemaine #4 : Les villes industrielles (et les villes socialistes) et les modèles marxistes\nSemaine #5 : Les métropoles américaines et l'école de Chicago, \nSemaine #6 : Les post-métropoles, fragments et différences\nSemaine #7 : Les villes mondiales et les mégacités\nSemaine #8 : Les villes intelligentes et la sociologie des sciences et technologies", "slug": "coursera-cities-are-back-in-town-sociologie-urbaine-pour-un-monde-globalise", "provider": "Coursera", "universitiesInstitutions": "Institut d'Etudes Politiques de Paris", "parentSubject": "Social Sciences", "childSubject": "Sociology", "category": "Sociology", "url": "https://www.coursera.org/learn/developpement-urbain", "length": "", "language": "English", "credentialName": "", "rating": 0.0, "numberOfRatings": 0, "certificate": "", "workload": ""}, {"courseId": 6618, "courseName": "Think Again III: How to Reason Inductively", "courseDescription": "How to Reason Inductively\n\nThink Again: How to Reason and Argue\nReasoning is important.

This series of four short courses will teach you how to do it well. You will learn simple but vital rules to follow in thinking about any topic at all and common and tempting mistakes to avoid in reasoning. We will discuss how to identify, analyze, and evaluate arguments by other people (including politicians, used car salesmen, and teachers) and how to construct arguments of your own in order to help you decide what to believe or what to do. These skills will be useful in dealing with whatever matters most to you.\n\nCourses at a Glance:\nAll four courses in this series are offered through sessions which run every four weeks. We suggest sticking to the weekly schedule to the best of your ability. If for whatever reason you fall behind, feel free to re-enroll in the next session.We also suggest that you start each course close to the beginning of a month in order to increase the number of peers in the discussion forums who are working on the same material as you are. While each course can be taken independently, we suggest you take the four courses in order.\n\nCourse 1 - Think Again I: How to Understand Arguments\nCourse 2 - Think Again II: How to Reason Deductively\nCourse 3 - Think Again III: How to Reason Inductively\nCourse 4 - Think Again IV: How to Avoid Fallacies\n\nAbout This Course in the Series:\nWe encounter fallacies almost everywhere we look. Politicians, salespeople, and children commonly use fallacies in order to get us to think what they want us to think. Think Again: Fallacies will show how to identify and avoid many of the fallacies that people use to get us to think the way they want us to think.\n\nIn this course, you will learn about fallacies. Fallacies are arguments that suffer from one or more common but avoidable defects:  equivocation, circularity, vagueness, etc. It’s important to learn about fallacies so that you can recognize them when you see them, and not be fooled by them. It’s also important to learn about fallacies so that you avoid making fallacious arguments yourself.\n\nSuggested Readings\nStudents who want more detailed explanations or additional exercises or who want to explore these topics in more depth should consult Understanding Arguments: An Introduction to Informal Logic, Ninth Edition, Concise, Chapters 13-17, by Walter Sinnott-Armstrong and Robert Fogelin.\n\nCourse Format\nEach week will be divided into multiple video segments that can be viewed separately or in groups.

En el mundo contemporáneo, el proceso de urbanización está alcanzando un nuevo pico con el incremento de las megalópolis (más de 15 millones de habitantes) como Calcuta, Los Ángeles, Daca, El Cairo, Tokio, Nueva York, Shanghái, Ciudad de México. o Seúl. Más allá de las metrópolis modernas, los investigadores intentan entender estas grandes zonas urbanas con el uso de distintos conceptos, tales como \"posmetrópolis\", \"ciudades globales\" y \"ciudades-regiones globales\". La clase estudiará debates y modelos de ciencias sociales de ciudades y metrópolis, para así analizar y comparar los desarrollos actuales. ¿Cómo podemos estudiar dichas ciudades cuando se convierten en megalópolis? ¿El tamaño importa, y para qué? ¿Acaso vemos la creación de un mundo urbano extenso o, en cambio, vemos más allá de la convergencia aparente de procesos complejos  de globalización comprendidos en relación con el capitalismo globalizado? ¿Es posible identificar las diferencias escondidas y el fortalecimiento de diversos mundos urbanos? ¿Cómo podemos lograr entender este mundo urbano cuando las ciudades no son unidades independientes, sino que tienen que compenetrarse en términos de territorio, instalación, y asimismo en materia de relaciones como el flujo, la movilidad y la circulación? ¿Cuál es la relevancia de los conceptos de las ciencias sociales desarrollados en el mundo occidental para poder analizar la transformación de Lagos? ¿Hasta qué punto puede el desarrollo sistemático de nuevas formas de comparación entre ciudades del norte y del sur cambiar las ciencias sociales y contribuir a superar el sesgo hacia la comparación nacional? \nPor el momento, y considerando las condiciones actuales del capitalismo, los asuntos políticos, económicos, culturales y sociales se convierten cada vez más en asuntos urbanos. En la concepción moderna del mundo, caracterizada por el tamaño, la construcción de viviendas, la división del trabajo diferenciada y la densidad de interacción, existen diferentes concepciones de ciudades que se han entremezclado y, a veces, hasta se han enfrentado.  Dichas concepciones resaltan diferentes procesos de integración: el aspecto material de la ciudad, muros, plazas, viviendas, calles, iluminación, servicios públicos, edificios, desechos e infraestructura física; el aspecto cultural de la ciudad en términos de imaginación, diferencias, representaciones, ideas, símbolos, arte, textos, sentidos, religión y estética; los principios políticos y las políticas en materia de control, poder, gobierno, movilización, políticas públicas, bienes, educación; el aspecto social de la ciudad considerando los disturbios, las desigualdades étnicas, económicas y de género, la vida cotidiana y los movimientos sociales; y el aspecto económico de la ciudad: división del trabajo, escalas, producción, consumo, comercio, entre otros.\nLos asuntos urbanos clásicos sobre las desigualdades, viviendas, gobierno e integración, se relacionan con cuestiones referentes al tejido urbano, asuntos de movilidad e instalación, desarrollo sostenible y riesgos, creación de ciudades ciborg, problemas de control social y disturbios, cultura urbana, innovación y desarrollo económico urbano.  \n\nTodos los vídeos realizados por Sciences Po para este MOOC están a cargo de Creative Commons (BY / NC / SA)\n\n\nPerfil recomendado\n\nEl curso está diseñado para estudiantes de pregrado, pero también puede ser de interés para estudiantes de posgrado y profesionales en el sector de asuntos urbanos.\n\n\nPrograma del curso :\n\nSemana 1: Introducción, definición, asuntos urbanos y el uso de modelos\nSemana 2: Ciudades europeas y el modelo weberiano de integración\nSemana 3: Ciudades coloniales y poscoloniales\nSemana 4: Ciudades industriales (y ciudades socialistas) y modelos marxistas\nSemana 5: Las metrópolis norteamericanas y la Escuela de Chicago \nSemana 6: Posmetrópolis, fragmentos y diferencias\nSemana 7: Ciudades globales y megaciudades\nSemana 8: Ciudades inteligentes y la sociología de la ciencia y la tecnología", "slug": "coursera-cities-are-back-in-town-sociologia-urbana-para-un-mundo-globalizado", "provider": "Coursera", "universitiesInstitutions": "Institut d'Etudes Politiques de Paris", "parentSubject": "Social Sciences", "childSubject": "Urban Planning", "category": "Urban Planning", "url": "https://www.coursera.org/learn/desarrollo-urbano", "length": "", "language": "English", "credentialName": "", "rating": 0.0, "numberOfRatings": 0, "certificate": "", "workload": ""}, {"courseId": 6626, "courseName": "Jacobi modular forms: 30 ans après", "courseDescription": "This is a master course given in Moscow at the Laboratory of Algebraic Geometry of the National Research University Higher School of Economics by Valery Gritsenko, a professor of University Lille 1, France.\nJacobi forms are holomorphic functions in two complex variables. They are modular in one variable and abelian (or double periodic) in another variable. The theory of Jacobi modular forms became an independent research subject after the famous book of Martin Eichler and Don Zagier “Jacobi modular forms” (Progress in Mathematics, vol. 55, 1985) which was cited more than a thousand times in research papers. This is due to many applications of Jacobi forms in arithmetic, topology, algebraic and differential geometry, mathematical and theoretical physics, in the theory of Lie algebras, etc. The list of mentioned subjects shows that my course might be useful for master and Ph.D. students working in different directions.\nMotivated undergraduate students can also study this subject. To follow the course one has to know only elementary basic facts from the theory of modular forms (for example, the paragraphs 1-4 of the chapter VII of Serre’s “A Course in Arithmetic” are enough).\nThe main hero of the course is the Jacobi theta-series. Using it we will construct a lot of concrete examples of Jacobi forms in one or many abelian variables, in particular, Jacobi forms for root systems.\nFor some of you, who will be successful with the theoretical exercises of the course, I am ready to formulate research problems for Master or Ph.D. thesis.

The financial crisis of 2007-2009 is a wakeup call that we need a similar evolution in the analytical apparatus and theories that we use to understand that system. Produced and sponsored by the Institute for New Economic Thinking, this course is an attempt to begin the process of new economic thinking by reviving and updating some forgotten traditions in monetary thought that have become newly relevant.\n\nThree features of the new system are central.\n\nMost important, the intertwining of previously separate capital markets and money markets has produced a system with new dynamics as well as new vulnerabilities. The financial crisis revealed those vulnerabilities for all to see. The result was two years of desperate innovation by central banking authorities as they tried first this, and then that, in an effort to stem the collapse.  \n\nSecond, the global character of the crisis has revealed the global character of the system, which is something new in postwar history but not at all new from a longer time perspective.  Central bank cooperation was key to stemming the collapse, and the details of that cooperation hint at the outlines of an emerging new international monetary order. \n\nThird, absolutely central to the crisis was the operation of key derivative contracts, most importantly credit default swaps and foreign exchange swaps. Modern money cannot be understood separately from modern finance, nor can modern monetary theory be constructed separately from modern financial theory.

We usually make these decisions with almost no thought, using what psychologists call “heuristics” – rules of thumb that enable us to navigate our lives. Without these mental shortcuts, we would be paralyzed by the multitude of daily choices. But in certain circumstances, these shortcuts lead to predictable errors – predictable, that is, if we know what to watch out for. Did you know, for example, that we are naturally biased towards selling investments that are doing well for us, but holding on to those that are doing poorly? Or that we often select sub-optimal insurance payment plans, and routinely purchase insurance that we don’t even need? And why do so many of us fail to enroll in our employer’s corporate retirement plans, even when the employer offers to match our contributions?\n\nBehavioral finance is the study of these and dozens of other financial decision-making errors that can be avoided, if we are familiar with the biases that cause them.

Websites crash, calendar not synchronising, or even a power blackout. Of course you have! But did you know that many of these errors are the result of communication errors either within a system or between systems? Depending on the system, the impact of software failures can be huge, even resulting in massive economic damage or loss of lives. Software, and in particular the communication between software-intensive systems, is very complex and very difficult to get right. However, we _need_ dependability in the systems we use, directly or indirectly, to support us in our everyday lives.\n\nSystem Validation helps you to design embedded system behaviour that is structurally sound. It also enforces you to make the behaviour simple and insightful; systems that are designed for sound behaviour are also much easier to maintain and adapt. System Validation is the field that studies the fundamentals of system communication and information processing. The techniques put forward in system validaton allow to prove the absence of errors. \n\nThis first course ’Automata and behavioural equivalences', builds the foundation of the subsequent courses, showing you how to look at system behaviour as state machines. It discusses behavioural equivalences and illustrate these in a number of examples and quizzes. This course explains labelled transition systems or automata to model behaviour for especially software controlled systems. An important question is when two behaviours represented by such automata are equal. The answer to this question is not at all straightforward, but the resulting equivalences are used as powerful tools to simplify complex behaviour. This allows us to exactly investigate and understand the behavioural properties of such systems precisely. Especially, in the combination with hiding of behaviour, equivalence reduction is a unique technique to obtain insight in the behaviour of systems, far more effective than simulation or testing. Using this insight we can make the models correct. Such models form an excellent basis for the production of concise, reliable and maintainable software.\n\nThis course is part I of the set of courses for System Validation. System Validation, as a set of courses, is part of a larger EIT Digital online programme called 'Internet of Things through Embedded Systems'.", "slug": "coursera-system-validation-automata-and-behavioural-equivalences", "provider": "Coursera", "universitiesInstitutions": "EIT Digital ", "parentSubject": "Computer Science", "childSubject": "Algorithms and Data Structures", "category": "Algorithms and Data Structures", "url": "https://www.coursera.org/learn/automata-system-validation", "length": "", "language": "English", "credentialName": "", "rating": 0.0, "numberOfRatings": 0, "certificate": 1.0, "workload": ""}, {"courseId": 6826, "courseName": "Embedded Hardware and Operating Systems", "courseDescription": "This course is intended for the Bachelor and Master's students, who like practical programming and making IoTs applications!\n\nIn this course we will talk about two components of a cyber physical system, namely hardware and operating systems. \n\n\nAfter completing this course, you will have the knowledge of both hardware components and operating systems.

He is known for articulating a “new story” of the universe that explores the implications of the evolutionary sciences and cultural traditions for creating a flourishing future.  \n\nThis course investigates Berry’s life and thought in relation to the Journey of the Universe project.  It draws on his books, articles, and recorded lectures to examine such ideas as: the New Story, the Great Work, and the emerging Ecozoic era.  The course explores Berry’s insights into cosmology as a context for locating the human in a dynamic unfolding universe and thus participating in the creative work of our times. In particular, we will examine Berry’s reflections on renewal and reform in the areas of ecology, economics, education, spirituality, and the arts.\n\n\t\nCourse Rationale:\n\n\tThomas Berry was an original, creative, and comprehensive thinker, especially regarding the critical nature of our global environmental crisis.  His intellectual importance resides in his response to the ecological crisis by bringing together the humanities and science in an evolutionary narrative.  In addition, he articulated the need for the moral participation of the world religions in addressing environmental issues.  He came to this realization largely through his study of cosmologies embedded within religious traditions.  Sensing the significance of these stories as “functional cosmologies” he explored the widespread influence that these stories transmitted through a tradition, for example, in rituals, ethics, and subsistence practices.\n\nUpcoming sessions:\nOctober 23, 2017 - December 11, 2017\nNovember 20, 2017 - January 8, 2018\nDecember 18, 2017 - February 5, 2018\nJanuary 15, 2018 - March 5, 2018\nFebruary 12, 2018 - April 2, 2018\nMarch 12, 2018 - April 30, 2018", "slug": "coursera-the-worldview-of-thomas-berry-the-flourishing-of-the-earth-community", "provider": "Coursera", "universitiesInstitutions": "Yale University", "parentSubject": "Humanities", "childSubject": "History", "category": "History", "url": "https://www.coursera.org/learn/thomas-berry", "length": "", "language": "English", "credentialName": "", "rating": 0.0, "numberOfRatings": 0, "certificate": 1.0, "workload": ""}, {"courseId": 6947, "courseName": "Journey of the Universe: The Unfolding of Life", "courseDescription": "Journey of the Universe weaves together the discoveries of the evolutionary sciences together with humanities such as history, philosophy, art, and religion.

It examines a range of dynamic interactions in the unfolding of galaxies, Earth, life, and human communities. It investigates ways in which we understand evolutionary processes and the implications for humans and our ecological future.  \n\nThe Journey course, thus, is based on a new integration that is emerging from the dialogue of the sciences and humanities. Journey tells the story of evolution as an epic narrative, rather than as a series of facts separated by scientific disciplines. This changes our perception so that we begin to see ourselves as an integral part of this narrative. By situating ourselves within this story we can better appreciate the complexity and beauty of processes such as self-organizing dynamics, natural selection, emergence, symbiosis, and co-evolution.

These are conducted after a new drug has been approved by the regulatory agencies and launched. In these studies, the new drug is prescribed in an everyday healthcare environ­ment using a much larger group  of patients.  This enables new treat­ment uses for the new drug to be developed, comparisons with other treatments for the same indication to be made, and determination  of the clinical  effectiveness of the new drug in  a wider variety of  patient types, and  more rare side effects, if any, may be detected .\n\nPre-marketing strategy should be instigated as early as Phase 1 clinical trials to ensure that the market's needs are incorporated into the new drug's overall develop­ment. Later phases when clinical results are presented at international medical conferences the marketing strategy is then refined in  order to develop an awareness amongst the medical community who will be prescribing the new drug.

It tells the story of key campaigns in US history, and by doing so it investigates how politics changed over time—and how understanding the past sheds light on the current campaign. From the arrival of \"dirty politics\" to the impact of the \"digital revolution,\" the course looks at the historical background to some of the key phenomena that shaped the controversy-laden campaign of 2016.\n\nThe five elections that we'll investigate are among the most significant in American political history. In 1800, Thomas Jefferson won the presidency in a contest that encouraged politicians to reform the electoral college, the system by which presidents are still chosen. The election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860 prompted the outbreak of the Civil War. It's an election that helps us to understand the development of political parties. In 1968, the Vietnam War was a dominant concern for Americans, and yet foreign policy played a secondary role in Richard Nixon's victory. Twelve years later, in 1980, Ronald Reagan won an election that initiated a new era of conservatism. Finally, we'll turn our attention to the election that took Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama, to the White House in 2008. Many saw the Obama's success not only as revealing the impact of the digital revolution on campaign politics, but also as signaling a turn to progressivism.  \n\nImage credits:\n\nCourse logo - \"Former President Truman holds a copy of the famous Chicago Daily Tribune paper declaring 'Dewey Defeats Truman'\" Harry S.

Over the past decades, a new figure has emerged that of the art manager. \nImagine you went to work every day to connect artists with audiences, vision with reality, and money with a mission. That is what managers in the arts do, they play an essential role in transforming the minds, lives, and communities through creative expression.\n\t\nThis course has been conceptualized to address the need of skills and techniques to help professionals and managers in running art and cultural institutions. \n\nLearning Objectives\nThere are three objectives to this course. First, we will approach the biggest issue cultural institutions face, the coexistence of managers and curators and giving evidence as to when, how, and why they can get along. Second, we will focus on some contemporary facets on what is means to manage a cultural institution and what cultural managers should expect and be able to face. And lastly, we will provide models and tools to design and implement appropriate courses of action to satisfy customers (visitors and audiences) and build an advantage over the competition.\n\nCourse Structure\nThe course is divided into six sections. Five sections are dedicated to specific aspects and themes of managing cultural institutions, while the sixth section is dedicated to individual interviews of prominent cultural institution managers on specific topics. The involvement of professionals and managers gives an incredible value to the learning experience of this course. \n\nEach module is paired with a quiz and discussion forums to reflect on the variety of the heritage management, its complexity, and the power of the network that we will build together during the course.\nSuccessful completion of the quizzes is required for a course certificate as explained in the Grading Policy page.\n\nIf you love art and want to make an impact in this unique and fantastic sector, this course will support you in understanding the peculiarities of this sector and how to leverage on its tools to make a bigger impact.\n\nLook forward to meeting you online!\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nVatican Museums: www.museivaticani.va\nCenacolo Vinciano: \nwww.beniculturali.it/mibac/export/MiBAC/sito-MiBAC/Contenuti/MibacUnif/Eventi/visualizza_asset.html_1283837989.html (ITA)\nFAI (Fondo Ambiente Italiano): eng.fondoambiente.it\nMUVE (Fondazione Musei Civici Venezia): www.visitmuve.it\nThe National Trust: www.nationaltrust.org.uk\nThe Archeological Site of Paestum: www.museopaestum.beniculturali.it   whc.unesco.org/en/list/842\nMuseo dell'Opera del Duomo (Florence): www.museumflorence.com\nMuseo del Violino: www.museodelviolino.org\n_________________________________\nDisclaimer - Since some of the videos are conducted with those whose native language is not English, we have decided to sometimes preserve their more emphatic speech to keep a tighter match between the audio and subtitles.", "slug": "coursera-arts-and-heritage-management", "provider": "Coursera", "universitiesInstitutions": "Università Bocconi", "parentSubject": "Business", "childSubject": "Marketing", "category": "Marketing", "url": "https://www.coursera.org/learn/arts-heritage", "length": "", "language": "English", "credentialName": "", "rating": 0.0, "numberOfRatings": 0, "certificate": 1.0, "workload": ""}, {"courseId": 7476, "courseName": "Advanced Linear Models for Data Science 2: Statistical Linear Models", "courseDescription": "Welcome to the Advanced Linear Models for Data Science Class 2: Statistical Linear Models.

Hence, their reliability and dependability increasingly depends on software. Defects can be fatal and extremely costly (with regards to mass-production of products and safety-critical systems).\n\nFirst, a model of the real system has to be built. In the simplest case, the model reflects all possible states that the system can reach and all possible transitions between states in a (labelled) State Transition System. When adding probabilities and discrete time to the model, we are dealing with so-called Discrete-time Markov chains which in turn can be extended with continuous timing to Continuous-time Markov chains. Both formalisms have been used widely for modeling and performance and dependability evaluation of computer and communication systems in a wide variety of domains. These formalisms are well understood, mathematically attractive while at the same time flexible enough to model complex systems. \n\nModel checking focuses on the qualitative evaluation of the model. As formal verification method, model checking analyzes\nthe functionality of the system model. A property that needs to be analyzed has to be specified in a logic with consistent syntax and semantics. For every state of the model, it is then checked whether the property is valid or not.\nThe main focus of this course is on quantitative model checking for Markov chains, for which we will discuss efficient computational algorithms.

Besides providing learners with a sound knowledge base of European laws and regulations, the series explores business considerations within a broader perspective by including inputs from leading law practitioners in the field. More specifically, the third course discusses how to compete on the internal market and protect your brand, product or invention. It includes legal disciplines such as Intellectual Property law (IP law), Competition law and specific branches within Public law, such as public procurement and state aid. \n\nAt the end of this course, you will have a basic understanding of how to:\n\n•\tFind and understand relevant laws and regulations governing the internal European Union market\n\n•\tProtect and defend a company’s products, brands and inventions by obtaining and licensing trademarks and patents\n\n•\tCreate a competitive edge for a company and apply the basic principles of EU competition law\n\n•\tConstruct and present a persuasive legal argument\n\n\nAbout the Series\n\nThe Lund series in European Business Law ranges from considering the basic structures and principles of the European Union to focusing on specialized areas of European Union law. The first course, Understanding the Fundamentals, examines the core structures and principles of the European Union. The second course, Doing Business in Europe, examines legal areas such as Company law, Labour law, Tax law, Environmental law and Private International law, and how they tie in to doing business in Europe. All three courses can be taken independently or in sequence depending on your needs and preferences.\n\nTo keep up to speed on the course series, visit our Facebook page at:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/eblmooc/\n\n\nSyllabus and Format\n\nEach course consists of a number of modules where one module represents about one week of work.

The University has 47 700 students and 7 500 staff based in Lund, Sweden. Lund University unites tradition with a modern, dynamic, and highly international profile. With eight different faculties and numerous research centers and specialized institutes, Lund is the strongest research university in Sweden and one of Scandinavia's largest institutions for education and research. The university annually attracts a large number of international students and offers a wide range of courses and programmes taught in English. \n\nThe Faulty of Law is one of Lund University’s four original faculties, dating back to 1666. It is a modern faculty with an international profile, welcoming both international and Swedish students. Education, research and interaction with the surrounding community are the main focus of the Faculty’s work. The connection between the three is particularly apparent in the programmes and courses offered by the university, including the university’s MOOC course in European Business Law. The students get the chance to engross themselves in traditional legal studies, while interacting with both researchers and professionally active lawyers with qualifications and experience from various areas of law.\nThe faculty offers three international Masters: two 2-year Master’s programmes in International Human Rights Law and European Business Law, and a 1-year Master’s in European and International Tax Law. Students from around 40 countries take part in the programmes which offer a unique subject specialization within each field, with highly qualified researchers and professional legal practitioners engaged in the teaching. \n\nThe Master’s programme in European Business Law provides an in-depth understanding of both the practical and the theoretical aspects of business law within the European Union. The programme provides both general and specific knowledge of the European Union legal framework, which is necessary for students intending to work as legal advisors or business decision-makers. The programme is delivered in English and is open to students with at least a three year degree in Law (Bachelor, LL.B, or equivalent) who want to specialise in European economic and business law.\nThe MOOC course in European Business Law is a great course to start with for students intending to apply for the Master’s programme in European Business Law. Even though the MOOC course does not grant credits previous knowledge of the subject is considered upon admission to the master’s programme.

Are these modes incompatible? Put another way: is the intellectually responsible thing to do to ‘pick sides’ and identify with one of these approaches at the exclusion of others? Or, are they complementary or mutually supportive? As is typical of questions of such magnitude, the devil is in the details. For example, it is important to work out what is really distinctive about each of these ways of inquiring about the world. In order to gain some clarity here, we’ll be investigating what some of the current leading thinkers in philosophy, science and religion are actually doing.\n\nThis course, entitled ‘Science and Philosophy’, will serve as the first of three related courses in our Philosophy, Science and Religion Online series, and in this first course we will ask important questions about the nature of scientific knowledge, its limits and implications for the disciplines of philosophy and religion, as well as for their intersection. \n\nWe begin by asking whether scientific claims aspire to absolute truth. For instance, are there any scientific claims that are absolutely true, or are they all true relative to the system of thought that generated them? If we accept the latter, does this also hold true of any claims we might make, including within the domains of philosophy and religion? In this Science and Philosophy course we will also be exploring in some detail current and exciting questions about the relationship between physics and faith, science and pseudoscience, creationism and evolutionary biology. \n\nThe second and third courses in the Philosophy, Science and Religion series—‘Philosophy and Religion’ and ‘Religion and Science’—will be launched later in 2017.

Shocked by economic assumptions of human behavior as self-centered and focusing only on what can be measured? Asking yourself if there are no sensible economic alternatives to free markets? Then you are at the right place to learn economics! \n\nThis is the first online course that teaches economics from a pluralist perspective. Economic pluralism means that a plurality of theoretical and methodological viewpoints is regarded as valuable in itself and is simply the best way in which economics can make progress in understanding the world. This MOOC will illustrate economic pluralism not only in substance but also in form. You will see not only me, a Professor of Economics, but also a pop-up Prof of our business school, who illustrates the actor perspective of firms, government and civil society. And you will meet an online student, based in Greece, who will help you through the tutorial videos in which I will explain key concepts, tools and techniques. \n\nI will not limit myself to the dominant theory, as almost every other course does. Instead, I will introduce you to four very different economic theories for the whole set of standard topics in microeconomics and macroeconomics. The theories are presented every time from broad and more interdisciplinary to narrow and more mathematical. The four theories that I like to introduce you to are Social Economics, Institutional Economics, Post Keynesian economics and, at the very end of each topic, Neoclassical Economics, for the special case of ideally functioning markets. But not everything is different in this course. Like every economics course, it includes numbers, diagrams, tables, equations, and some calculations. \n\nWhy would you go through the effort of learning the basics of four theories instead of one? Because it will help you to see why many economists cannot predict crises, whereas others can see signals but are often not being listened to because they do not belong to the dominant school of thought. It will also enable you to see that it is just one theory claiming economic agents to be self-centered and focusing on the measurable only. Other economic theories go well beyond these limitations. And, finally, the pluralist approach will provide you with policy alternatives to neoliberalist policies promoting free markets. \n\nThe objective of this course is twofold. First, to enable you to understand different economic viewpoints, linked to important traditions in economic thought, and basic economic concepts belonging to these theoretical perspectives. Second, to enable you to do some basic economic calculations that are important in economic life, such as calculating an inflation rate, and in economic policies, such as estimating the rough gains from trade for both trading partners, and in economic arguments, such as in calculating utility maximization with given prices and budgets.\n\nI hope you will enjoy the course!", "slug": "coursera-introduction-to-economic-theories", "provider": "Coursera", "universitiesInstitutions": "Erasmus University Rotterdam", "parentSubject": "Social Sciences", "childSubject": "Economics", "category": "Economics", "url": "https://www.coursera.org/learn/intro-economic-theories", "length": "", "language": "English", "credentialName": "", "rating": 0.0, "numberOfRatings": 0, "certificate": 1.0, "workload": ""}, {"courseId": 8037, "courseName": "Spanish Vocabulary: Meeting People", "courseDescription": "¡Hola! ¿Como Estas?

Entrepreneurs generally start with a mission, a new idea that they want to bring to the world. If the idea is original, it is probably not expected by the market, which has to be educated. This is a very costly experience. Entrepreneurs need to gather capital at the start of the journey. They need to articulate clear plans, define objectives and resources and raise money accordingly. They also need to manage cash for two reasons: i) because the better it is managed, the less you need to raise with outsiders; ii) because generation of cash flow is the pillar of the valuation of the company. And we should add that the practical reason why a company gets bankrupted is because it runs out of cash..\nThe course is based on this belief. We look at the myth of the balance sheet and explain the dynamics of cash flows and the way they should be managed. We also investigate the basics of venture capital and provide a practical roadmap to entrepreneurs.\n\nMany courses are dedicated to the same topic. Our originality is that we operate in the advisory board of the private equity firm, Xerys and are board members of their venture companies.

My name is Ken Pienta, Professor of Urology and Oncology at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. I have been studying prostate cancer and treating patients with prostate cancer for over 25 years.\nOver 1,000,000 men worldwide and 230,000 men in the United States are diagnosed with prostate cancer every year. Three hundred thousand men worldwide and 30,000 men in the US are dying from prostate cancer every year. As people live longer, the incidence of prostate cancer is rising worldwide and prostate cancer continues to be a major health problem. Thanks to years of dedication and commitment to research we’ve made enormous advances in the treatment of prostate cancer, But there is still a lot of work to be done. In this Understanding Prostate Cancer course, I will provide an introduction to the biology of prostate cancer as well as how it is identified and treated at various stages of the disease. \n\nI've put together this course in order to introduce you to the essentials of prostate cancer.\n\nBy the time you finish this course you'll be able to\n\tDefine risk factors for prostate cancer\n\tUnderstand current prostate cancer screening guidelines\n\tUnderstand prostate cancer staging\n\tUnderstand treatments for localized prostate cancer\n\tUnderstand treatments for advanced prostate cancer\n\tUnderstand treatments to alleviate the symptoms caused by prostate cancer\n\nThis Understanding Prostate Cancer Course should be helpful to anyone who wants to develop a deeper understanding of prostate cancer biology and treatment.

Along the way, we encounter Perpetua and her martyrdom in Carthage; the struggles of Augustine the bishop in North Africa; the zeal of Celtic monks and missionaries; the viciousness of the Crusades; the visions of Brigit of Sweden; and the fracturing of Christianity by Martin Luther’s protest. We hear the voices of great theologians as well as of those branded heretics by the Church, a powerful reminder that the growth of Christianity is a story with many narratives of competing visions of reform and ideals, powerful critiques of corruption and venality, and exclusion of the vanquished.  The troubled history of Christian engagement with Jews and Muslims is found in pogroms and expulsions, but also in the astonishing ways in which the culture of the West was transformed by Jewish and Islamic learning.\n \nWe shall explore the stunning beauty of the Book of Kells, exquisitely prepared by monks as the Vikings terrorized the coast of England.

We will read from the Gutenberg Bible of the fifteenth century, which heralded the revolution brought by the printing press. We will travel from Calvin’s Geneva to Elizabeth’s England to Trent, where a Catholic Council met to inaugurate a modern, missionary Catholic church. We will walk through the great Escorial of Philip II of Spain, hear the poetry of John of the Cross, and follow the Jesuits to Brazil and China.\n \nChristianity in the West was forged in the fires of conflict and tumult, and it brought forth both creativity and violence.

On space walks and through windows, course instructor Ron Garan was struck by the stunning beauty of the Earth from space but sobered by knowing how much needed to be done to help this troubled planet. And yet on the International Space Station, Garan, a former fighter pilot, was working work side by side with Russians, who only a few years before were “the enemy.” If fifteen nations could collaborate on one of the most ambitious, technologically complicated undertakings in history, surely we can apply that kind of cooperation and innovation toward creating a better world. \n\nIn this course Garan will convey what it was like learning to work with a diverse group of people in an environment only a handful of human beings have ever known. But more importantly, the course will address how we can apply the orbital perspective here at home, embracing new partnerships and processes to promote peace and combat hunger, thirst, poverty, and environmental destruction. This course is a call to action for each of us to care for the most important space station of all: planet Earth.\n\nThe course will also involve participation in the Earthrise-2068 project.

Here we invite you to develop analytical skills and deep understanding about a complex, controversial policy problem – one with no simple, easy answers. About half a billion people on our planet still lack access to improved water supplies and about two billion do not have improved sanitation services, leading to an unknown but very large number of avoidable deaths each year from water-related diseases. Millions of dollars are spent on avoidable health care expenditures, and people – mostly women – spend many billions of hours carrying water from sources outside the home. Reducing these costs is a major global challenge for us all in the 21st century. Join us to explore the challenging and complex political, economic, social, and technical dimensions of the policy interventions that donors, national governments and water utilities use to address this challenge. This second MOOC consists of the following seven sessions:\n\n•\tSession 1: Introduction and how our ‘ancient instincts’ affect water policy interventions.\n•\tSession 2: Planning better policy interventions: Roles, features and examples of planning protocols.\n•\tSession 3: Water pricing, tariff design and subsidies.\n•\tSession 4: Providing information to households and communities to improve water and sanitation conditions.\n•\tSession 5: Changing the institutions that deliver water and sanitation services: Privatization in developing countries.\n•\tSession 6: Changing institutions: Lessons from the UK water privatization story.\n•\tSession 7: Changing institutions: Improving regulation of the water and sanitation sector.\n\nYour instructors for this course have worked in and studied this sector for many years.

We explore the world of cats and dogs and how our relationships with them vary around the world and have changed over time. We ask if we can really know what our animals are thinking or trying to communicate through their facial expressions and behaviours.  \n\nFrom our beloved pets to street dogs, shelter dogs/cats and welfare challenges, we explore the world from their perspective and examine how their genetic make-up may influence their behavioural responses and choices. We dispel common behavioural myths by looking through a scientific lens, asking questions about the function and development of their behaviour.. We explore how their senses help them to interact with their world and how they communicate with each other and us!\n\nFinally, we ask whether we impose unrealistic expectations on our cats and dogs and how this affects their ability to live alongside us. We ask, what can we do to be more responsible pet owners and to ensure the welfare of all cats and dogs in society?

It starts by talking about energy itself and where it comes from. This includes how much we have, who has it, who uses it, and what that all means. The video clips are produced in a fast-paced multimedia format during which Professor Ruzic throws in fun and demonstrations. There are multiple-choice questions to check your understanding and some more in-depth exercises to guide you deeper into the subject.\n\nAfter explaining the main things we use energy for – our cars and electronics! – fossil fuels are examined in detail. Want to really learn about fracking or pipelines? Watch these segments. The environmental effects of fossil fuels are taught as well. Global warming, acid rain, and geoengineering all are in this part of the course. Part of their solution is too. Renewables follow, with clips on solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, biofuels, etc. You’ll even see Professor Ruzic in a corn field and in the middle of a stream showing how you could dam it up.\n\nFinally, nuclear power is taught in detail – how it really works and what happens when it doesn’t work, as in Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, and Fukushima, as well as how we are making it today, which is shown here without political preconceptions. In this course, economics takes center stage. People will ultimately do whatever costs the least, so energy policy is most effective when it is targeted at the user’s wallet.\n\nThroughout the course there are 24 segments on “How Things Work.\" These guides to everyday life are tremendously varied, covering everything from fireworks to making beer to what happens backstage at a theater.

Even Thomas Jefferson, who over time developed a deep loathing of Henry (some would say jealousy), had to admit that “it is not now easy to say what we should have done without Patrick Henry.” Edmund Randolph, a patriot leader in his own right, explained that “It was Patrick Henry … awakening the genius of his country, and binding a band of patriots together to hurl defiance at the tyranny of so formidable a nation as Great Britain.” \n\tYet, today, Patrick Henry is ill-remembered; most Americans might recall at best perhaps a snippet from a famous speech: “give me liberty, or give me death.” The reasons for our historic forgetfulness are several: after the Revolution, Henry chose to oppose ratification of the U.S. Constitution, believing that it created a distant and too-powerful government, and he refused proffered position in George Washington’s administration, diminishing his historic memory. Equally important, Henry died in 1799 shortly after a political campaign in which, at Washington’s behest, he opposed Jefferson’s and James Madison’s ill-advised radical states’ rights attack on the U.S. government, and Jefferson spent the next twenty-six years systematically attacking Henry’s legacy.\n\tPatrick Henry, who helped to ignite a revolution, deserves better. This course will explore how he over¬came challenges to reach the pinnacle of Virginia politics and unite Americans behind a challenge to Britain – the eighteenth century’s super-power, why he opposed the U.S. Constitu¬tion, and why he then came out of retirement to defend the people’s Constitution against the attacks of Jefferson and Madison. \n\tParticipants should evaluate Henry’s role in proclaiming a revolution and consider whether he had an equally important role in saving it. The course should also develop an improved appreciation for the complex political, economic, and religious forces that shaped the early republic. As a biographical course, it also demonstrates how personalities play an important role in even the most foundational national history.\n\n\nImage Attribution:\nThe background image for this webpage is Patrick Henry before the Virginia House of Burgesses by Peter F.

The drinking water and electricity infrastructures are two of fourteen subsectors comprising what are known as \"lifeline infrastructure\". The 2013 National Infrastructure Protection Plan identifies four lifeline infrastructure sectors: 1) water, 2) energy, 3) transportation, and 4) communications. These sectors are designated \"lifeline\" because many other infrastructures depend upon them.  The drinking water subsector is part of the water sector, and the electricity subsector is part of the energy sector.  Both subsectors are overseen by the Department of Homeland Security National Protection and Programs Directorate which manages the DHS National Infrastructure Protection Program. The NIPP employs a five-step continuous improvement program called the Risk Management Framework. NIPP implementation is overseen by DHS-designated Sector-Specific Agencies staffed by various Federal departments. The Sector-Specific Agencies work in voluntary cooperation with industry representatives to apply the Risk Management Framework and document results in corresponding Sector-Specific Plans.  The program began in 2007 and the most recent Sector-Specific Plans were published in 2016. In February 2013, President Obama issued Executive 13636 directing the National Institute of Standards and Technology to develop a voluntary set of recommendations for strengthening infrastructure cybersecurity measures. EO13636 also asked Federal agencies with regulating authority to make a recommendation whether the NIST Cybersecurity Framework should be made mandatory. The Environmental Protection Agency who is both the SSA and regulatory authority for the drinking water subsector recommended voluntary application of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. The Department of Energy who is both the SSA and regulatory authority for the electricity subsector replied that it was already implementing the Electricity Subsector Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model, which indeed was what the NIST Cybersecurity Framework was based on.

In this course we examine the origins of homeland security and its co0nnection with cybersecurity. Homeland security is about safeguarding the United States from domestic catastrophic destruction. Catastrophic destruction comes in two forms: natural and manmade. For most of history the manmade variety came in the form of warfare and required the combined resources of a nation state. All that changed March 20th, 1995. On that date, members of a quasi-religious cult in Japan attacked the Tokyo subway system using Sarin gas. It was the first deployment of a weapon of mass destruction my a non-state actor. The power of destruction once reserved to nation states was now available to small groups, even individuals. The incident was a wake up call for governments around the world. Defense establishments designed to keep rogue states in check were practically useless against non-state actors. Overnight, the number of potential enemies multiplied a hundred, maybe even a thousand-fold. In response to the Tokyo Subway Attacks, the United States took measures to protect itself from WMD attack by non-state actors. Those measures were still being enacted when the nation was attacked on 9/11. On September 11, 2001, nineteen hijackers inflicted as much damage as the Imperial Japanese Navy on December 7, 1941. The investigating 9/11 Commission noted the attacks for their \"surpassing disproportion\". The hijackers had achieved WMD effects without using WMD. They did this by subverting the nation's transportation infrastructure, turning passenger jets into guided missiles. Again, the security implications were profound. Non-state actors seeking to inflict domestic catastrophic destruction did not need to import, fabricate, or acquire WMD as the nation was surrounded by the means of its own destruction in the form of critical infrastructure. The vulnerability of critical infrastructure had not gone unnoticed. Again, in response to the Tokyo Subway attacks, which themselves had been an attack on Japanese infrastructure, President Clinton in 1996 commissioned a panel to investigate the threat to United States' infrastructure. The panel replied in 1997 that there was no immediate threat to US infrastructure, but they were concerned with the growing risk of cyber attack. The same cyber physical systems that fueled the explosive growth of the Internet were being incorporated into Industrial Control Systems that underpinned much of the nation's critical infrastructure. The panel noted that the knowledge and skills necessary to mount a cyber attack on the nation's infrastructure was growing. As a result of this observation, President Clinton in 1998 ordered the protection of US critical infrastructure, especially from cyber attack. Following 9/11, critical infrastructure protection and cybersecurity were designated core missions in the 2002 Homeland Security Act establishing the new Department of Homeland Security. They remain core missions to this day, but many don't see the connection. The connection is this: cybersecurity is essential to critical infrastructure protection, which is essential to homeland security, which is about safeguarding the United States from domestic catastrophic destruction.  I look forward to working with you in the coming lessons.

We see tinkering as a serious endeavor—one that is generalizable across content and especially good at interweaving disciplines in a way that leads to complex projects and individualized learning opportunities. Tinkering has recently been introduced into the educational field as a potential driver of creativity, excitement, and innovation in science learning. It is seen by many as an effective means to engage in exploring STEM concepts, practices and phenomena. Tinkering typically blends the high and low tech tools of science along with a strong aesthetic dimension that supports children’s (and adults’) self expression.\n\nNB: This is a hands-on course, so you will need several tools and materials to do weekly activities. You are welcome to purchase only what you don't already have—or even better try to scrounge them from surplus stores! We have put together a list of recommended materials, which you can find here: http://bit.ly/motion-materials\n\nFor over a decade, the Exploratorium has been developing science-rich tinkering activities for both children and adults. We see tinkering as a fun yet serious endeavor—spanning many disciplines and content areas and fostering connections between art, science, and technology. Learners follow their own path to understanding by investigating tools and materials and exploring questions that interest them. This opens up a wide range of possible answers rather than any specific “right” one, particularly for teaching STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) subjects in the classroom. This course centers on activities related to Motion and Mechanisms, which offer a wealth of opportunities for thinking through making.\n\nIn this course, we won’t just show you how we develop tinkering activities; we’ll also delve into why. We’ll focus on three important aspects: activity design around specific materials, facilitation strategies, and environmental organization. We’ll also share some guiding principles and learning indicators we’ve developed that can help you integrate tinkering into your elementary and middle-school science program. Whether you’re new to making or a seasoned tinkerer, we hope this course will help you take the next step!\n\nOUR APPROACH TO TEACHING\n\nThis is a hands-on workshop, not a lecture-based class. Participation is essential! We want everyone to be making and tinkering together: trying things out, asking questions, sharing ideas, and reflecting together as a community. This is a wonderful chance to tinker and learn alongside people from all over the world and from all walks of life, so don’t be shy!\n\nPLEASE NOTE: We have put a great deal of effort towards creating a supportive space that encourages exploration. We’ll give you a few ways to get started; prompt you to share your own observations and experience as learners, designers, and facilitators; and hopefully spark interesting conversations and discoveries along the way. While it’s not a requirement, we encourage you to take this class with a friend or colleague, or meet with other people in your area: having support or doing activities with others will enhance your experience and help you stay engaged.\n\nThis project was funded by generous support from Overdeck Family Foundation and the National Science Foundation.", "slug": "coursera-tinkering-fundamentals-motion-and-mechanisms", "provider": "Coursera", "universitiesInstitutions": "Exploratorium", "parentSubject": "Education & Teaching", "childSubject": "STEM", "category": "STEM", "url": "https://www.coursera.org/learn/tinkering-motion-mechanisms", "length": "", "language": "English", "credentialName": "", "rating": 0.0, "numberOfRatings": 0, "certificate": 1.0, "workload": "5 hours a week"}, {"courseId": 8862, "courseName": "The Science of Health Care Delivery ", "courseDescription": "The Mayo Clinic and Arizona State University Alliance for Health Care has developed innovative Science of Health Care Delivery training programs which introduce scientific approaches to quality improvement for patient care and population health, while also examining ways to reduce health costs.

We see tinkering as a serious endeavor—one that is generalizable across content and especially good at interweaving disciplines in a way that leads to complex projects and individualized learning opportunities. Tinkering has recently been introduced into the educational field as a potential driver of creativity, excitement, and innovation in science learning. It is seen by many as an effective means to engage in exploring STEM concepts, practices and phenomena. Tinkering typically blends the high and low tech tools of science along with a strong aesthetic dimension that supports children’s (and adults) self expression.\n\nFor over a decade, the Exploratorium has been developing science-rich tinkering activities for both children and adults. We see tinkering as a fun yet serious endeavor—spanning many disciplines and content areas and fostering connections between art, science, and technology. Learners follow their own path to understanding by investigating tools and materials and exploring questions that interest them. This opens up a wide range of possible answers rather than any “right” one, particularly for teaching STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) subjects in the classroom. This course centers on circuit-related activities, which offer a wealth of opportunities for thinking through making.\n\nIn this course, we won’t just show you how we develop tinkering activities; we’ll also delve into why. We’ll focus on three important aspects: activity design around specific materials, facilitation strategies, and environmental organization. We’ll also share some guiding principles and learning indicators we’ve developed that can help you integrate tinkering into your elementary and middle-school science program. Whether you’re new to making or a seasoned tinkerer, we hope this course will help you take the next step!\n\nOUR APPROACH TO TEACHING\n\nThis is a hands-on workshop, not a lecture-based class. Participation is essential! We want everyone to be making and tinkering together: trying things out, asking questions, sharing ideas, and reflecting together as a community. This is a wonderful chance to tinker and learn alongside people from all over the world and from all walks of life, so don’t be shy!\n\nPLEASE NOTE: Although this course will not have active instructor participation, we have put a great deal of effort towards creating a supportive space that encourages exploration. We’ll give you a few ways to get started; prompt you to share your own observations and experience as learners, designers and facilitators; and hopefully spark interesting conversations and discoveries along the way. While it’s not a requirement, we encourage you to take this class with a friend or colleague or meet with other people in your area: having support or doing activities with others will enhance your experience and help you stay engaged.\n\nREQUIRED COURSE MATERIALS\n\nYou will need several tools and materials to do weekly course activities. Pre-bundled materials are available from the Exploratorium store at www.artoftinkering.com. Please obtain all materials as soon as possible, well in advance of when you will need them in the course.

You will see that development can be studied in various domains and at various levels of understanding, from different angles and disciplines. Importantly, you will come to understand that processes within and between the various domains and levels of organization continuously interact to shape development. This implies that understanding development requires taking an interdisciplinary approach.\n\nIn order to help you organize your thinking about this complexity you will learn more about the developmental systems approach and theories related to that. We will look, amongst other things, at the brain and motor development, cognitive, language and social-emotional development and all the factors that have an influence on development.\n\nTo illustrate how an interdisciplinary approach helps to understand child development you will see how researchers from various disciplines and backgrounds study child development at Utrecht University.

Africa is not an exception, considering the actual and potential impacts of climate change and climate variability that will threaten its vulnerable sectors and human populations. African countries are projected to experience changing rainfall patterns, rising sea levels, and higher temperatures that will affect food security, agricultural production, water availability, and public health, among others. These climate change impacts and climate variability can further produce social and political problems, such as rural-urban migration and water resource disputes.   \n\nFurthermore, the low levels of development in many African countries, as well as limited institutional, infrastructural, and technical capacities to respond successfully to climate change impacts and climate variability, can exacerbate the situation. In terms of contribution to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, although African countries are the lightest polluters, it has also become apparent that alternative energy sources can offset the increasing energy demand and dependence on biomass. Addressing climate change offers possibilities for low-carbon development. Moreover, there are promising mechanisms that can address both climate change actions and development goals simultaneously. \n\nAt the city level, strengthening resilience, or the ability to respond to and absorb the effects of a hazardous event in a timely and efficient manner and to sustain this ability in the future, and adaptation; the process of adjusting to actual or expected climate change stimuli or their effects, should be at the forefront of planning.  Local governments have an important role to play through the provision of adequate infrastructure, regulation of land use, and other public services that are crucial for urban resilience. Mobilizing local governments, in collaboration with national governments, non-governmental organizations, and international organizations, among others, is also critical for an integrated multi-sectoral approach to climate change. \n\nThe Course on Planning for Climate Change in African Cities provides the foundation for understanding cities’ exposure and sensitivity to climate change, and how cities can manage these impacts in the face of growing uncertainty. It does so by introducing the basic concepts of urban resilience and adaptation, by using illustrative case studies in different African cities. Furthermore, this module provides lectures on the different approaches for climate change planning, whether ad hoc, strategic or mainstreaming; introduces the different steps in the planning cycle – from initial assessment to monitoring and evaluation; and presents the different decision support and assessment tools for prioritizing climate change actions. This course broadens the discussion on planning for climate change by engaging learners to apply their knowledge and practice their decision-making skills in a simulated exercise.\n\nIn line with development that minimizes the harm caused by climate change impacts, while maximizing the many human development opportunities presented by a more resilient future, we ask: what are the connections between urban risk and vulnerability? How is climate change and urban resilience conceptualized and applied in practice? Which policies and measures should be introduced to address climate change? Finally, how to choose among different measures that address climate change adaptation, urban resilience, and other development objectives? \n\nCourse Objectives:\nAt the end of this course, learners should be able to:\n\n•\tRecognize the effects, impacts, and drivers of climate change in cities\n•\tUnderstand the drivers of urban risk and vulnerability in the context of climate change \n•\tDistinguish the typologies, approaches, and tensions of climate change adaptation \n•\tExplain the different approaches and steps in climate change planning \n•\tExamine the decision support and assessment tools for climate change\n•\tDevelop a climate change plan based on participants’ city contexts", "slug": "coursera-planning-for-climate-change-in-african-cities", "provider": "Coursera", "universitiesInstitutions": "Erasmus University Rotterdam", "parentSubject": "Science", "childSubject": "Climate Change", "category": "Climate Change", "url": "https://www.coursera.org/learn/climate-change-africa", "length": "", "language": "English", "credentialName": "", "rating": 0.0, "numberOfRatings": 0, "certificate": 1.0, "workload": ""}, {"courseId": 9156, "courseName": "From Brand to Image: Creating High Impact Campaigns That Tell Brand Stories", "courseDescription": "There are many different ways to approach clients to assess their needs and develop creative campaigns which fulfill your creative desires.

Some of us like to count, others hate it, but any person uses numbers everyday to buy things, pay for services, estimated time and necessary resources. People have been wondering about numbers’ properties for thousands of years. And for thousands of years it was more or less just a game that was only interesting for pure mathematicians. Famous 20th century mathematician G.H. Hardy once said “The Theory of Numbers has always been regarded as one of the most obviously useless branches of Pure Mathematics”. Just 30 years after his death, an algorithm for encryption of secret messages was developed using achievements of number theory. It was called RSA after the names of its authors, and its implementation is probably the most frequently used computer program in the word nowadays. Without it, nobody would be able to make secure payments over the internet, or even log in securely to e-mail and other personal services. In this short course, we will make the whole journey from the foundation to RSA in 4 weeks.

Os álbuns deixaram de ser criados apenas em estúdios, agora também são criados em quartos. À primeira vista, isso é libertador. Qualquer pessoa pode criar um álbum por um custo bem baixo, basta comprar alguns equipamentos e um pacote de software. Mas, se você for mais a fundo, verá que não é tão fácil assim. É preciso conhecimento, dedicação e criatividade para produzir música.\n    \nFornecer conhecimento é o propósito deste curso. Não importa o tipo de música que você está produzindo, há um grande conjunto de ferramentas que você precisará usar.  Cada lição deste curso demonstrará um conjunto diferente de ferramentas de produção musical, seguindo vagamente o processo da produção musical de gravar, editar e mixar. \n\nVamos começar com algumas noções sobre a natureza do som e como o percebemos. Em seguida, vamos analisar os componentes necessários para gravar áudio em um computador, para que você compreenda os dispositivos pelos quais o som precisa se deslocar em um processo de produção musical. \n    \nDepois de gravado, o som precisa ser organizado em uma linha de tempo, um processo conhecido como edição. A edição nos permite dar a impressão de execuções perfeitas e criar muitos dos sons que ouvimos na música contemporânea. A ferramenta de edição contemporânea é a estação de trabalho de áudio digital (DAW, Digital Audio Workstation), um software que armazena e organiza todos os recursos de um projeto musical. Vamos focar as ferramentas de edição que são essenciais na produção de música contemporânea e que são fornecidas por todas as DAWs. \n\nApós a edição, os sons devem ser combinados ou mixados, por isso vamos analisar a mesa de mixagem, que pode ser um local muito criativo se você souber usá-la. Vamos explorar as funcionalidades básicas das mesas de mixagem em hardware e software, inclusive volume, panning, mudo, solo, barramentos, inserções, envios e submixagens. O processo de mixagem, no entanto, engloba mais ferramentas do que a mesa de mixagem fornece. O som também deve ser processado, ou seja, modificado de modo a fazer com que seu estado gravado se enquadre no contexto da música. Vamos analisar a compressão, a equalização e o retardo, além de examinar os muitos efeitos de áudio que são extensões desses dispositivos e como eles são usados em um contexto musical.\n    \nNo fim das contas, o processo de produção musical depende da sua criatividade. A criatividade é um produto da mente, e ela permanece armazenada ali, sem ser expressada, até que as ferramentas certas são usadas da maneira certa para compartilhá-la com o mundo.

This course will provide you with an introduction to the most recent research in the field of health effects of air pollution as well as a broader understanding of sources and spread of air pollution and what we should do about it.\n \nWhat is air pollution? What are the sources? How and where are we exposed outdoors and indoors? What happens in the body? Which diseases are the result? Who are the most vulnerable? How can we assess the effects of air pollution? And what should we do to reach the Sustainable Development Goal to “substantially reduce the number of deaths and illnesses from hazardous chemicals and air, water and soil pollution”? These are some of the important questions we will address in the course.\n\nDuring the course you will meet researchers and experts from the University of Copenhagen and the Technical University of Denmark. They work with different aspects of air pollution and health: toxicology, exposure assessment, epidemiology, engineering and health impact assessment.
